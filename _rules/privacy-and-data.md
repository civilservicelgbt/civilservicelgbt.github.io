The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is a volunteer-led employee network for the UK Civil Service. We follow Civil Service policies and procedures.

This policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you use this website, [register as a member](/join-us) of our network, or use our services.

## What information do we collect about you?

We collect website usage information on our websites. Our analytics are non-invasive and respect your privacy. Our analytics do not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We do not “fingerprint” you via your IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of collecting analytics. Our analytics do not collect personal information, or track you across sites.

When you register as a member of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network using our [registration form](/join-us) we collect some personal data about you. We also collect information from you when you register for our events or complete voluntary surveys.

When registering for any of our services or to attend our  events, you may be asked to enter your name and e-mail address, and other information about you.

## How will we use the information about you?

We collect information about you so that we can run the network and offer services to you. The kinds of ways we use your information include, but are not limited to:

- sending you information about events you register for, and keep you informed about changes to event details
- delivering our programmes of work
- sending you information we think might be of interest to you about LGBT+ issues in the Civil Service through our regular email alerts
- understanding who uses our services, attends our events and engages with our programmes, so that so we can plan our work to be relevant to our membership
- improve our website and email alerts

So that we can provide you with services, we use your data when:

1. **you have given explicit consent**: we sometimes explicitly ask you to give clear, explicit consent for us to use your personal data
2. **it is in our legitimate interests**: we sometimes use your personal data when it is necessary to do so

In all cases, we use this data so that we can provide you with services or information that are relevant to you as an LGBT+ civil servant, ally or other person interested in our work, and inline with [our constitution](/about/constitution)[^lawful-basis].

[^lawful-basis]: We process this data on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union.

Where we collect sensitive personal data, like information about your sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or whether you have a disability, this is processed on the same basis[^special-cat-data].

[^special-cat-data]: We process this data on the basis of Article 9(2)(a) and 9(2)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union.

We will not share your personal information with other organisations for marketing purposes.

We use several third party services to store and use data you provide to us, so that we can provide our services to you. These include but are not limited to:

- **GOV.UK Notify** for bulk email
- **Google Workspace** for our email and office software

## How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.

## What is your data retention policy?

We aim to only retain information for as long as is strictly necessary to provide you with a service. We regularly review and delete data that we believe we no longer need to provide you with the services we offer.

## Third party links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our site. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
