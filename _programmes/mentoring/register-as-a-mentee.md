## About this publication

## Before you register

Before you register, you should read read [our guidance documents](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/about-our-mentoring-programme) so you know what to expect on the programme.

If the guidance doesn't answer your question, you can also email us at [mentoring@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt).

## Registration deadline

Registrations for the first round of the mentoring programme will close on 31 July 2021.

We will not be able to accept your registration after this point. You will need to wait until the next round.

## Register as a mentee

**Give your career a boost and sign up as a mentee.** The right mentor can help you to refine your career goals, identify opportunities for development and build your networks.

As a mentee, you'll be asked to:

1. **Set up 'speed mentoring' sessions with each mentor we match you with.** It is your responsibility to arrange a suitable time and date. You should meet each mentor for an initial 30 minute session.
2. **Decide if you want to keep a mentor.** If you feel you can learn something from one of the mentors you meet, ask them if they can be your mentor long-term.
2. **Lead your relationship with your mentor.** If you are successful in securing a long-term mentor, it's your responsibility to organise meetings and lead your relationship with them.

As a mentee, you can expect to:

1. be offered a short induction session for new mentees
2. receive published guidance on how to maximise your role as a mentee
