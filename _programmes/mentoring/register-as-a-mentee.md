## Register as a mentee

**Give your career a boost and sign up as a mentee.** The right mentor can help you to refine your career goals, identify opportunities for development and build your networks.

As a mentee, you'll be asked to:

1. **Set up 'speed mentoring' sessions with each mentor we match you with.** It is your responsibility to arrange a suitable time and date. You should meet each mentor for an initial 30 minute session.
2. **Decide if you want to keep a mentor.** If you feel you can learn something from one of the mentors you meet, ask them if they can be your mentor long-term.
2. **Lead your relationship with your mentor.** If you are successful in securing a long-term mentor, it's your responsibility to organise meetings and lead your relationship with them.

As a mentee, you can expect to:

1. be offered a short induction session for new mentees
2. receive published guidance on how to maximise your role as a mentee
