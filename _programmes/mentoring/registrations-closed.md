Thank you for your interest in the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme.

The window to register for this round of the programme is now closed. We can no longer accept registrations for either mentors or mentees as the matching process has started. The programme is intended to run annually; please come back next year for another chance to take part.

If you registered before the deadline, then we will contact you by email soon with your mentor or mentee matches.

## Further information

For more information about the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, please read [our guidance documents](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/mentoring).

If the guidance doesn't answer your question, you can also email us at [mentoring@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt).
