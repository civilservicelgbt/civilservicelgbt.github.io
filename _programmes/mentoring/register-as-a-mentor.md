Use this forms to register as a mentor on the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme.

## Before you register

Before you register, you should read [our guidance documents](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/about-our-mentoring-programme) so you know what to expect on the programme.

If the guidance doesn't answer your question, you can also email us at [mentoring@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt).

## Registration deadline

**Registrations for this round of the programme close on 17 June 2022.** We will not be able to accept your registration after this point. You will need to wait until the next round.

## Register as a mentor

**Give something back and become an LGBT+ mentor.** Acting as a mentor can help other, less experienced staff get on with their career. It can be a rewarding experience for you too; you can learn new skills and it makes a great corporate contribution.

As a mentor, you'll be asked to:

1. **Meet with up to 3 mentees for 'speed mentoring'.** You will be asked to meet for one, 30 minute session with each mentee. They will contact you to arrange a suitable time and date.
2. **Agree to mentor at least one longer-term mentee.** Once you have met all your mentees, we'd ask that you agree to keep meeting at least one of them to provide them with a mentoring relationship on an ongoing basis.

As a mentor, you can expect to:

1. be matched with someone one or two grades more junior to you
2. be offered a short induction session for new mentors
3. receive published guidance on how to maximise your role as a mentor
4. have the chance to join a network of other mentors who you can speak to for advice too
