As part of PrideON, we're launching a brand new podcast.

In each episode of *the PrideON podcast* we'll be chatting to inspiring LGBT+ civil servants about their lives, identities what pride means to them. 

In the first few episodes, we're talking to:

- the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's chair, Kate Hughes, about how the network is changing during the pandemic and the value of taking part in Pride
- two of the Network's new vice-chairs, James Jefferson and Marc Fitchett, about the PrideON programme of digital events
- Lucy Pedrick from DCMS about the accessibility of traditional Pride events, bi inclusion and intersectionality

The first episode of *the PrideON podcast* will launch on Monday 15 June 2020 and new episodes will be released every week.

## Be a guest on the podcast

We'd like to keep this podcast going for as long as possible and we're still looking for more guests.

Taking part is easy and it's all very informal: you just need a spare 30 to 45 minutes for the interview and a topic for us to chat about. There's no preparation required.

If you'd like to talk to one of us, [get in touch](/about/contact-us/).
