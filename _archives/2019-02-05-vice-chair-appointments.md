excerpt: "We’re opening up additional vice chair positions, and here’s how you can apply."

> Applications have now closed. We will contact successful applicants soon.

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is led entirely by volunteers. Currently around 50 volunteers from across government are involved in delivering our projects, running our events, and representing your views to senior leaders in the Civil Service. 

It's a lot of work. We want to make sure we can continue to deliver as a network which is why we're decided to appoint some additional vice-chairs to our senior leadership team. 

The vice-chair is an important role that, alongside the chair, coordinates our work and volunteers, develops our strategic plans, and leads of specific projects. If you’re looking for a stretching volunteer role that can make a difference in the Civil Service, then this is the role for you.

Our constitution doesn't specify how these roles need to be constituted, nor does it require an election, so we'll be appointing the roles through fair and open competition. Find out more about what the role involves, and how to apply, below. 

## How to apply

To apply for the role you will need to submit a personal statement to [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).

Your personal statement should:

- be no fewer than 500 words and no more than 1,000 words long
- explain why you want to be a vice-chair
- explain what skills and experience you can bring to the role, in line with the role description below
- explain what areas you would be interested in leading on

### Application deadline 

The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on 1 April 2019. Late applications will not be accepted.

Applications will be marked on a 1 to 7 scale, as used in standard Civil Service recruitment.

If you score above the minimum pass mark, you will be invited to interview in late April and will commence the role from 1 May 2019.

## Role description

As a vice-chair you will work as part of a small senior team responsible for the day-to-day running of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. You will be jointly responsible for the following:

- planning and executing discrete projects on topics of interest to you and other volunteers
- coordinating one or more groups of volunteers to deliver on projects outlined in our business plan
- representing the Network to senior stakeholders across government, to Civil Service HR colleagues and to local departmental networks
- regularly communicating about your work in an open and transparent manner via our website and social media

The vice-chair role can be demanding, and you should expect to spend at least two or three hours a week on Network activity. Whilst line managers are encouraged to provide you with facility time to undertake this work, you may need to use some of your own time to undertake the role too.

The role is entirely voluntary, but expenses can usually be paid for costs incurred whilst undertaking network activity. 

If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).
