The Health Policy Fast Track Scheme (HPFTS) is DHSC’s accelerated development scheme for high potential staff with an interest in health policy. The Scheme launched in 2018 with an internally-recruited Pilot cohort, and the first externally-recruited cohort are due to join the department in September 2019. Participants are selected on ability, potential and passion for improving health and social care policy, and as such represent the health and social care leaders of the future. The Scheme has some similarities to Fast Stream but focuses more on the specific health and social care policy skills needed and how we work the NHS and our Arm’s Length Bodies.

The Scheme consists of up to four placements across three years, in policy roles, private office or similar corporate roles, and in an Arm’s Length Body (ALB) or the NHS. Participants begin in HEO-level roles, aiming to progress to Grade 7 standard by the end of the scheme. Alongside their placements, participants are offered a variety of learning and development opportunities including an Msc in Health Policy, policy and personal impact courses, mentoring, coaching and senior sponsorship.

Applications for the September 2020 intake will open in October, so if you or anyone you know would be interested in applying, please keep an eye out on the NHS training scheme website and CS Jobs for further information on how to apply. We are happy to offer adjustments to the application process as required. If you have any queries, please email <hpfts.operations@dhsc.gov.uk>.
