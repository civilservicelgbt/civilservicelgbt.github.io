Jonathan Slater, Permanent Secretary from the Department for Education has been named as the next lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex diversity champion for the Civil Service. Jonathan takes over the role from Dame Sue Owen, who retires this month. 

The news was announced via a [Civil Service blog post on GOV.UK](https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2019/04/25/last-chance-to-nominate-for-the-civil-service-diversity-inclusion-awards/) authored by Cabinet Secretary, Mark Sedwill. 

The Cabinet Secretary also announced that Melanie Dawes (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government) will take over Dame Sue's former role as overall Diversity and Inclusion champion and as the Chair of the Civil Service People Board, and that Antonia Romeo (Department for International Trade) would become the new Gender Champion.
