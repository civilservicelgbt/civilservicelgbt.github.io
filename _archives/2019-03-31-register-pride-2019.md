This year, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be taking part in a number of Prides across the country. 

You can find out more about which Pride events we're planning to attend in [our recent news post](/pride/).

## Registrations are now open

**Registrations for all Pride events are now open**. 

### Pride events outside London 

For Pride events taking place outside of London, just [complete this form](https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9) and you will be registered to attend.

**Please note:** This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems -- if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.

We will send you final details for the event around 2 weeks in advance of the event date. We may also contact you before the event so that you can order t-shirts and other Pride materials for your local event.

**New location added:** Colleagues at the Home Office will be leading a Civil Service group at Liverpool Pride on 27 July 2019. If you'd like to join them, please register using the same form as all the other events — we've updated it to include this new location.

### Pride in London

Places in the Civil Service group for Pride in London will be allocated via a lottery. This is because places are limited in the parade and we want to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to attend.

To register your interest, [complete the registration form](https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9) and make sure you tick 'London' when asked which events you want to attend.

**Please note:** This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems -- if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.

We will close registrations on 14 May 2019, and allocate places by 1 June 2019. We expect to be able to confirm your place no less than 4 weeks before the event.

## Questions

If you have questions about this process, you can email <info@civilservice.lgbt>. Please note that this inbox is staffed by volunteers and we get a lot of email -- it might take a while to reply to you.

**Only email us to ask for updates if the event you want to attend is less than 2 weeks away and you haven't heard from us.** The more emails we receive, the less time we have to organise things for you.
