This year, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be taking part in a number of Prides across the country. 

At the moment, we are planning to participate in Pride events in:

- [Belfast](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-03-pride-belfast/): 3 August 2019
- [Cardiff](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-24-pride-cymru-cardiff/): 24 August 2019
- [Edinburgh](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-06-15-pride-in-london/): 22 June 2019
- [London](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-06-pride-in-london/): 6 July 2019
- [Newcastle](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-20-northern-pride-newcastle/): 20 July 2019
- [Preston](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-09-28-pride-preston/): 28 September 2019

We may also take part in other Pride events across the UK, and this will be based on the availability of volunteers to organise this in their local area.

## Registering to attend

### Pride in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh

You will need to register to let us know you're coming as part of the Civil Service walking groups in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh. 

**Registrations are now open.** [Find out more about how to register](/register-pride-2019/).

### Pride in London

For Pride in London **only**, we will be registering attendees a little differently this year.

Last year more than 2,000 people tried to get a place in our walking group, and we only had around 100 places. We want to ensure our group is as diverse as possible, and that the allocation of places is as fair as it can be. 

We think the fairest way to allocate places is via a lottery. There will be no reserved places for specific departments or networks.

We will also be collecting diversity information from those who put their name into the lottery. This is so we can try to allocate places in line with the demographics we would expect to see across the country as a whole.

**Registrations are now open**. We will allocate places once we have a confirmed group size from Pride in London; we expect this to be in May. [Find out more about how to enter the lottery](/register-pride-2019/).

## T-shirts, placards, and other materials

We are currently attempting to secure funding to pay for all the materials we need for Pride this year at each location. 

If this is not possible, we will set up a mechanism for people to purchase t-shirts, placards and other materials via our website.

## Next steps

We will continue to post updates to our website as more information becomes available.

If you're organising a Civil Service group for Pride in your local town or city, let us know. We're happy to advertise it for you on our events page and via our regular newsletter.
