## The Candidates
Each candidate has written an election statement. You can find Alan’s statement [here](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/alan-edwards-election-statement), and John’s statement [here](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement). The next stage in the election process is to hold hustings so you can ask the candidates questions and hear more from them on their vision for the Network and its future. We will hold two hustings sessions via video conference during the week commencing 13 September 2021. One will be at lunchtime and one will be towards the end of the day to enable as many people as possible to attend. Details of the events and how to attend and register questions will be posted on our [Events page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events) our website.

## Voting
Following the hustings there will be a voting period. Each member network has one vote they can cast in the election and member networks must canvas either all members or all network committee members. Please contact your local LGBT+ network to find out details of how they are managing this part of the process. Network leaders who still need to register their network to vote should do so by emailing kate.hughes@cabinetoffice.gov.uk by 12 noon on 15 September 2021. 

The window for member networks to cast their vote is noon on 22 September 2021 to noon on 29 September 2021. Registered networks will receive details of how to cast their vote after 15 September.
