## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

I am an RAF Police Officer currently serving as the Officer Commanding Security Flight for the Air Warfare Centre based at RAF Waddington. My job is looking after the day to day security of people, information and assets such as aircraft across the UK and in our 6 permanent locations in the USA.
 
## How long have you been an ally?  

I have been involved with D&I and the creation of an inclusive workplace for many years but having had the chance to work alongside some of our transgender colleagues here in the AWC, I was inspired by their courage and determination to be true to themselves. I decided to become a formal ally in 2017 and undertook the Stonewall Course. I am also a member of the newly formed RAF LGBT Allies network.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

There are still pockets of discrimination or unwillingness to accept those who are different within Defence and an Ally can often open a conversation or challenge perceptions where they hear or see inappropriate behaviour. I also think it’s really important that Allies bridge a gap between the LGBT+ community and those who work with, manage or may need to offer support to the community and to help them understand how they can the best from their people. We are also trying to encourage those serving parents, grandparents, siblings and friends who may be struggling with a loved one coming out as Gay or Trans to seek support for themselves in the family journey.
 
## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

My email signature block has the proud to an ally slogan and logo embedded into it so every time I send an email, I send the Ally message and I send a lot of emails both internally and internationality; I’m really proud that Defence supports me in sending this message. I wear my Ally badge on my Lanyard and am a member of the local RAF LGBT+ Freedom Network and I marched with the first ever Military Contingent to take place in Lincoln Pride this year.
