> We’ve added additional events on 21 February and 27 February, and amended some events in Cardiff.

LGBT History Month is an annual celebration of LGBT history, culture and identities, marked each February in the UK.

This year's theme is "Peace, Activism and Reconciliation", in recognition of 50 years since [the Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots).

Civil Service LGBT+ Network volunteers, and a number of local departmental networks, are organising events this February — some of them tied to History Month, and others just as part of our regular work. Come along and join the events. Here's a quick run down.
