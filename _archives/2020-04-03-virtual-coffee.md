The Ofgem LGBT+ Network is setting up a LGBT+ virtual coffee club to ensure that LGBT+ people can still reach out to like-minded people.

At the start of each fortnight you will be sent the name and contact details for another member of the coffee club that you’ve been randomly paired with. You can then arrange a timeslot for you to catch-up with this person for whenever you like within those 2 weeks, you can even arrange several catch-ups if you wish!

To sign up to the coffee club, simply send an [email to us](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) showing your interest to us before 14th April. You can still sign up if you express your interest after this date, however you’ll have to wait until the 2nd round of pairings to get matched up with someone. 

Please feel free to share this message around, so that as many people can join in as possible.

>Is your departmental network hosting an online event that is open to all civil servants? Please [let us know](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) and we will share it on our website.
