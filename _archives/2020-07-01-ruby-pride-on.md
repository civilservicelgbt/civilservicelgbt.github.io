### Transcript: 

I've got something to show you. Look at my wee badge! This is for my first ever pride, London 92. I'd just come down to get work and suddenly, there's this amazing, fabulous free festival going on, where everyone was welcome.

Now I never really understood categories and labels for people, and this suited me just fine cause it's all about inclusion. Back then I was involved in action groups, committed to equality and civil rights, and be calling folk out for injustice and bigotry. As I've got older I've learned to pick my battles but pride is, and always has been a protest and there's still much needs to change.

However, it's also a celebration. It gives us visibility, that gives us connection. Going to pride is a big deal. It's an event you prepare, for you dress up for, it's gay christmas! I think I had my first ever champagne breakfast before one pride, and it has certainly not been my last.

I've also been going to my local pride recently, it's much smaller so you don't immediately lose everyone that you came with, but still it gives us visibility, it gives us connection. This year I would have been marching with my MOD colleagues, but I'll still be celebrating online and locally for socially distanced. But I'll still be smiling, waving, talking, listening.

And look! (Shows rainbow bunting)

There's only so much you can do, but you can do so much more than you think
