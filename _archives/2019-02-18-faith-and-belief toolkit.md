The Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Policy team is developing a Faith and Belief toolkit which is due to be launched in Spring 2019. 

They are particularly keen to hear from people who identify as LGBT+ and hear how their departments have created an inclusive environment for staff with respect to faith and belief. 

If you would like to contribute, please contact [Natalie Ogene](mailto:natalie.ogene@cabinetoffice.gov.uk), Faith and Belief Policy Adviser.
