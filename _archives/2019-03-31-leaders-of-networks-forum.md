The Leaders of Networks Forum is a new regular event that will help shape the work of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and give the leaders of local LGBT+ networks a space to share experiences, frustrations, resources, ideas and solutions.

We held our first Leaders of Networks Forum in January. You can [read the write up from the meeting](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2019/02/06/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout) on our website. 

Our next meeting is scheduled for 25 April 2019 from 3:00pm to 5:00pm.

The event is open to anyone who helps to lead a Civil Service LGBT+ staff network in a department, agency or arm's length body, or to anyone that volunteers with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network itself.
