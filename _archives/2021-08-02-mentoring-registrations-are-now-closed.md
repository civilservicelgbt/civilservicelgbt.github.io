The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new initiative from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. It aims to give LGBT+ civil servants support in developing their career by speaking to more senior LGBT+ mentors.

**The registration period for the 2021 programme has now closed.** 

## What happens next

Now that registrations are closed, we will start the process of matching mentors and mentees. We expect to have finished this process in August, at which point all mentors and mentees will receive an email confirming their matches. If you *have not* heard from us by 1 September, please email us to ask for an update.

We will also update our [mentoring page](/mentoring) when we have sent the final notifications out, so you know you won't have missed it.

Whilst you wait for your matches, you might also want to:

- attend one of our [mentoring induction events](/events)
- read our guidance for [mentors](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/resources-for-mentors) and [mentees](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/resources-for-mentees)
- complete our [pre-programme survey](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/consultation/mentoring-pre-programme-survey)

## If you didn't register

If you did not register, you cannot take part in the programme this time and will have to wait until next year. The programme is large and administratively intensive; because of this, we cannot make any exceptions. Sorry!
