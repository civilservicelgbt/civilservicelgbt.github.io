The Scottish Government LGBTI network and the HMRC LGBT+ network, Prism, are working together to organise this year's participation in Pride events in Scotland.

Just like last year, the Civil Service will be taking part in two Pride events in Scotland. Pride in Edinburgh will take place on 16 June 2018, and Pride in Glasgow will take place on 14 July 2018. 

Join us and take your place in the annual Pride Parades on both dates.
