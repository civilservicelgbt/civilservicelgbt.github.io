**The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is organising the Civil Service's participation in Pride events across the UK again this year.** This blog post is to let you know what we've done so far, how you can take part in upcoming Pride events, and how you can help organise for your own local Pride.

## Where we're taking part

We have already taken part in multiple Pride events this year, including:

- Pride in Edinburgh
- Pride in London

With thanks our regional organisers, and working with local networks, we are also planning to take part in:

- [**Pride in Glasgow**](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/07/14/pride-in-glasgow/), 14 July 2018: where we will be in the pride parade
- [**Pride in Nottingham**](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/07/28/pride-in-nottingham/), 28 July 2018: where we will be in the pride parade
- [**Pride Cymru, Cardiff**](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018/08/25/pride-cymru-cardiff/), 25 August and 26 August 2018: the Welsh Government will be leading a parade group on 25 August, and a stall on both days

We had intended to take part in **Manchester Pride**. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to organise participation in Manchester Pride this year. The cost of participation is significantly higher than most pride events across the country, and we were therefore unable to secure a place. The Civil Service will still be represented there, as Government Equalities Office will be holding a stall on Canal Street.

> If you would are organising a Civil Service group as part of Pride in your local area, please [get in contact with us](/about/contact-us/).

## T-shirts

We have a number of t-shirts from last year that we can send to those participating in Pride events. These have Civil Service and CSRA logos on them.

We are providing these free of charge, whilst we still have stock, to anyone who would like one at events over this Pride season. If you would like some for your local Pride, please [contact us](/about/contact-us/).
