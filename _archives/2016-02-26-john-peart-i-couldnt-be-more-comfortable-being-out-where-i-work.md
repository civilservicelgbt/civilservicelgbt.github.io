"<em>What did you do last night?</em>"

Those 6 words can be really stressful to an LGBT person. It sounds silly, but when you're not 'out' at work, being asked such a simple question can turn into a minefield of lies and misdirection.

When you're hiding your sexuality at work, answering personal questions about what you do <em>outside</em> work can take up a lot of brain-space. It's easy to remember what you were <em>really</em> doing, but remembering what you <em>made up</em> you were doing so people don't suspect you're gay can be a real chore. That's why it's so important to make workplaces open and inclusive.

I'm lucky; I couldn't be more comfortable being out where I work.

I joined the Civil Service in 2013 after starting the Digital and Technology Fast Stream. Currently, I'm in the Cabinet Office, working at the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>.

One of the things that's surprised me about GDS in particular is how easy it was to be out and open about my sexuality. In part, I think that's because there are <a href="http://ukcsra.com/2016/02/19/stephen-foreshew-cain-civil-servants-have-been-at-the-forefront-of-equality-work/">visible LGBT senior role models</a>.

Members of our senior civil service are out and that helps to set the tone for the entire organisation. It means that — unlike other places I've worked — no one I've spoken to has experienced LGBT discrimination at work since they joined GDS.

As LGBT staff, we have the support of the entire organisation - from the top, all the way down. Our leaders have supported us in setting up an LGBT network; and we have straight allies all over GDS that take an active interest in LGBT issues. It's this kind of support that makes it easy to be out at work; and because I don't have to worry about hiding myself from my colleagues, I can get on with putting my whole-self into my job.

You can't  give 100% at work when you're distracted with inventing a second life to hide behind. Creating an inclusive work environment for LGBT people is essential to creating a motivated and productive team. That's why I'm so lucky to work at a place like GDS.
