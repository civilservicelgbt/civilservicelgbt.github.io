## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

I am the Defence Cyber Protection Partnership Communications Manager, working in the Ministry of Defence (MOD). I have been in post since November 2017. I’ve recently completed my 19th year in the MOD.

## How long have you been an ally?  

I became an ally about two and a half years ago.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

Being an ally is important because it sets the tone in the workplace environment to be one that encourages and values input. It welcomes people in, so a person isn’t fearful about who they are. I also think places that are ‘people positive’ are the best ones to be in.

## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

I use a signature block and include it in bios particularly when presenting to industry audiences. I’ve spoken at three MOD Ally events, written an intranet blog, marched in Pride 2017, and helped organise a government-wide briefing on sexuality, mental health and vetting. On top of that, I've organised LGBT networking lunches, contributed to Mission Critical and arranged two Stonewall Ally training sessions. I'm also setting up work to produce a leaflet so people do not self-exclude from jobs requiring security clearance.
