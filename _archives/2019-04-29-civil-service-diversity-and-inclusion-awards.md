The Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards are back for their 13th year. [Nominations are open](http://www.diversityandinclusionawards.com/) now and close on 3 May 2019.

You can nominate any civil servant or Civil Service team for one of 8 different awards, including 'Employee Network Excellence' and 'Championing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI) Inclusion'. 

Speaking about the award, Chief People Officer and Diversity and Inclusion Awards Champion, Rupert McNeil said:

> "It is a great privilege to launch the 2019 Civil Service Diversity & Inclusion Awards.  
> 
> The Awards are now in their 13th year, and it is incredibly inspiring to see the range of nominations each year, demonstrating all the passionate and creative work happening across government.  
>
> One of my top priorities is for the Civil Service to be the UK’s most inclusive employer, representative of modern Britain and the public we serve. The Awards offer us a chance to recognise and champion those behaviours that build a more inclusive culture - ensuring fairness, making sure nothing holds our people back from making their best contribution, and making better decisions collectively.  
>
> Being nominated for the Diversity & Inclusion awards is recognition of the contribution and success of those colleagues who have gone out of their way to champion difference and make the Civil Service a better place to work. 
> These awards provide an opportunity to showcase our success, both to colleagues and to wider society, and I strongly encourage you to participate. If you know of an individual or team doing outstanding work in this area, then please do nominate them. I know we will have an exciting list of nomination".
