*The PrideON podcast* is a brand new podcast from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. In each episode we'll be chatting to inspiring LGBT+ civil servants about their lives, identities what pride means to them. 

**Episode 1 of the podcast is now available**. You can download it from wherever you get podcasts.

In the first episode, John Peart – former vice-chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network – talks to Lucy Pedrick. Lucy works at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. She’s also been doing lots to improve the inclusion of bisexual people within the Civil Service, helping to establish “[BiSpace](/bispace/)”. 

John and Lucy talk about:

- the opportunities a socially-distant pride season provides for creating more accessible LGBT+ spaces
- the work Lucy has done on bi-inclusion
- how to be a better ally
