The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme – an initiative developed by the **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** – has been shortlisted in this year's Civil Service Awards.

The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is a new cross-departmental scheme. Since work began in April 2021, 425 mentors and 550 mentees have registered, more than 500 people have been given training, and more than 1,150 mentoring matches have been facilitated by the programme. By mid-2022, it will have generated more than 3,000 hours of mentoring. It is one of the largest mentoring programmes of its kind in the Civil Service.

The mentoring programme has nominated in the Developing and Supporting People Award category. The Developing and Supporting People Award recognises projects and individuals that demonstrate excellence across learning, skills development, strengthening capability, and talent management, or highly effective contributions to promoting or improving health and wellbeing within the Civil Service.

The shortlisted nominees for the award are:

- Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme
- Heart Matters Walk-Up Stairs & Space-My-Pace Walking Group/HMRC Table Tennis Club,  HM Revenue & Customs
- Zoe Taylor, Ministry of Defence

We're thrilled to have the programme recognised through the Civil Service Awards. Congratulations to the other nominees who have been shortlisted. The winning programme or individual will be announced later this year.
