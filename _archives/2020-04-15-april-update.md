## We held our first digital social...

Last Thursday we held our first ever digital social. Thank you to all our fantastic members who joined. We had lots of fun and we hope you did too! We also joined together at 20:00 to #ClapForOurCarers. 
 
To find out more, you can read the blog post [here](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/04/15/digital-social-blog).

## Lesbian Visibility Week 

Next week is Lesbian Visibility Week (20th- 26th April). We would love to profile a few of our members who identify as lesbian. To get involved, please [email us](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).  

If your department is hosting any digital events to mark the week, please [let us know](mailto@info@civilservice.lgbt) and we will share it on our website and social media platforms.

What is Lesbian Visibility week? 

Run by the DIVA Media Group, Europe’s biggest LGBTQI media group, Lesbian Visibility Week is to show our solidarity with every woman within the LGBTQI community, as well as celebrate lesbians.

It is essential that Lesbian Visibility Week is a voice for unity and lifts up ALL women, especially those who come from marginalised communities. Recent research (Pride Matters survey, conducted by Pride In London 2018) has shown that gay women are almost twice as unlikely to be out in the workplace as gay male colleagues.


## Calling all Network chairs! 

What is your department doing to support members of the LGBT+ community at this present time, and – looking further ahead, what are your thoughts on the Stonewall WEI for this year?

We’ve had some interest from network chairs on the above issues and will be looking to facilitate a discussion in the near future. Please [get in touch](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) with your thoughts and if this if something you would be interested in joining.
