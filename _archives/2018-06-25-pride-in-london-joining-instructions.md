## About this guidance 

This guidance is for civil servants who are joining the cross-government Pride in London parade group on 7 July 2018.

**There are significant changes to the way Pride in London's parade will work this year, so please read this guidance carefully.**

## This year's parade theme and our group

### #PrideMatters

This year's Pride in London theme is #PrideMatters. 

Tweet us [@cslgbt](https://www.twitter.com/cslgbt) or email us at [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) to tell us why Pride matters to you as civil servant.

### We have a float

We have a a float in the parade this year, in addition to 120 walking group places. 

If you have lots of energy and you'd like to be on the float, [let us know](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt). 

## Meeting points, arrival times, and parade times

**Pride in London have changed the form up process this year**. To reduce waiting times, groups only need to arrive around 60 minutes before they are due to actually take part in the parade. This will not change when we would expect to take part — but it means you can enjoy more of the day without waiting in the form up area.

As a result, we will be meeting later in the day than usual and we will move to the parade form up area later.

### Initial meeting point

Our initial meeting point will be Fitzroy Square Gardens. This is the same meeting point as last year.

You should aim to arrive at 1:00pm, where we will give out wristbands and take group photos.

We will leave the meeting point and move into the parade form-up area at around 2:00pm.

### Lining up in the parade

Our group needs to arrive at the Parade form up area on Portland Place at around 2:10pm.

This year, the Civil Service is in Group F, near the back of the parade. 

We expect our parade group to be in the parade between 3:00pm and 5:00pm.

## Wristbands

All members of our parade group are required to wear a wristband, provided by Pride in London. You will need a wristband to access the parade waiting area, and may be refused entry if you are not wearing one.

Wristbands will be given to those who registered in advance first, and any uncollected wristbands will be given to other civil servants who want to join the group.

### Collect your wristbands

**We will only be handing out wristbands on the day**. You can collect your wristband on Saturday afternoon between 1:00pm and 1:45pm at our initial meeting point at Fitzroy Square Gardens.

### Spare wristbands

Any wristbands that are uncollected by 1:45pm will be handed out to others so that all those that want to participate can do so. **If you were unsuccessful in securing a place online** and want one of our spare wristbands to join the group, please arrive at 1:30pm at the meeting point.

### If you can no longer attend

If you can no longer attend please let us know as soon as possible by emailing [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) or cancel your place on EventBrite so that it can be offered to someone else. We have people on our waiting list – please don’t let them miss out!

## The Parade

### The route

The parade will start from Portland Place and will go down Regent Street. It will turn right on to Pall Mall, moving through Trafalgar Square, finishing on Whitehall.

### During the parade

Remember, you are representing the Civil Service and government at this event, so you:

- **must** adhere to the Civil Service Code at all times
- **must not** promote any political messaging during the parade, or do anything that might be perceived as jeopardising your impartiality
- **must not** drink alcohol on the parade route or bring glass bottles to the parade form up area or parade route

Additionally, Pride in London have asked that:

- you **do not** hand out stickers during the Parade
- you **do not** use confetti cannons, coloured smoke or throw things into the crowd
- you **do not** bring pets (except guide dogs) on the Parade route

### End of the parade

Unlike previous years, you should follow the parade float down Whitehall when the parade is complete and you have gone through the finishing arch.

## Dress code and t-shirts

You should wear suitable clothing for the event, but there is no set dress code. Remember that you are representing the government at the event — so please don't wear anything that might cause embarrassment to you, the group or the Civil Service. 

T-shirts with Love is GREAT branding will be available on the day. Attendees should have received a poll asking them for sizes in the week before the parade.

If you would prefer to wear a work uniform, or t-shirts from your own Civil Service organisation, feel free to do so.

## Weather

It is forecast to be between 28 and 30 degrees on the day. Please bring water in *plastic* bottles and ensure that you are wearing suncream.  

## After the parade: social

We will be holding post-parade social at the Civil Service Club in Westminster. We are operating a guest list to access the social: if you are not on the guest list, or if you are not already a member of the Civil Service Club, you will not be able to enter the venue.

If you attend the parade as part of our parade group, or you registered for a social ticket when tickets became available, you are already on the list.

Please note that the venue is limited in size, and so you may be refused entry if the venue is full. If the venue is full, we'll overflow into St James's Park.
