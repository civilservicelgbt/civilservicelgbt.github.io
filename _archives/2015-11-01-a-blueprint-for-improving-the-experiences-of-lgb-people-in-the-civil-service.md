## Publication description

For the past few months, we’ve been doing a lot of research into the experiences of civil servants who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or as another minority sexual orientation (LGB). We’re publishing the result of that work today.

This is our plan to make the Civil Service better for LGB* people.

Whilst the Civil Service has often been a beacon of best practice on diversity and inclusion, that progress has largely stalled. Today, we set our challenge to the Civil Service, and a set of 22 actions we’re going to take to make working for government better for those with minority sexual identities.
