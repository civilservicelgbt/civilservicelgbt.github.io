excerpt: "In our business plan, we committed to setting up a forum for network chairs and leaders. Here's what we're planning to do."

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network exists to connect LGBT+ civil servants across government and represent their interests. We do that in two ways: 

1. by setting up activities and events for individual civil servants who are our members, whether or not they they have an LGBT+ network in their local building
2. by working with local networks -- where they exist -- to gather information and act on their feedback

In our [business plan](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/) and [prior consultation](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/), we said we wanted to create strong local networks. We are aiming to provide support and assurance to networks, so that every civil servant can access a locally based LGBT+ network wherever they live. 

We also said we wanted “to create a forum where network leaders can collaborate and work together to support one another”. We called it the “Heads of Networks Forum”. **We're setting it up now, starting this month**. We've also changed the name -- to the “Leaders of Networks Forum” -- in recognition that not every great departmental leader is necessarily the chair of their network.

This forum is aimed at those helping to lead and run departmental networks; not LGBT+ champions or wider volunteers of local networks. Representatives from all departmental and agency networks are welcome to attend. 

We propose that it meets every 3 months to discuss issues important to network leads, get updates from central Civil Service policy teams, and to work on shared issues. We also think this should be a regular chance for networks to hold the cross-government network to account and to offer help to deliver on shared projects. A terms of reference will be agreed at the first meeting.

The first meeting of the Leaders of Networks Forum will be on **31 January 2019** at the Department for Education's building in central London. Conference calling and Skype video calling will also be available for those who can't physically make it.

In order to attend, you need to register. Please [contact us via the event page](/event/2019-01-31-leaders-of-networks-forum/) to let us know you want to attend.

We'll publish the agenda about a week in advance, and send venue and dial-in details directly to delegates. We hope to see you then!
