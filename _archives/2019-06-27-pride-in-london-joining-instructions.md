This year’s Pride in London will be the biggest yet; and we’re planning a bigger set of activities for civil servants joining us in London. 

This document explains everything you need to know for the day. 

**If you are joining us as part of parade float and walking group**, please pay particular attention to  the information relating to wristband collection below.

## Pre-parade picnic

### What you need to know

This is your chance to meet with LGBT+ and ally colleagues ahead of us marching in the Pride in London parade. It’s also your chance to have something to have some lunch before the main event.

Bring your own food and drink with you.

Feel free to bring partners, friends or colleagues to the meet up; everyone is welcome.

We expect the weather to be around 24 degrees Celsius, sunny with some cloud[^1].  There is around a 20% chance of rain throughout the day. Remember to wear suncream and bring plenty of water with you.

## Parade

### Starting location

The starting point for the parade is on Portland Place, immediately south of Regent’s Park underground station. 

### Time

We will leave our Regent’s Park pre-parade meeting point at 1:30pm.

We aim to arrive on Portland Place at the meeting point no later than 2:00pm.

> **Stay informed**
> 
> We will be setting up a WhatsApp broadcast list for attendees this year. This will be used to provide updates to all attendees during the event. 
> In order to receive these messages you must add [+447392 136 444](tel:+447392136444) to your address book.

### Things you need to know

#### Wristbands

Entrance to the parade area is restricted to those wearing a Pride in London wristband. You must collect a wristband from us at the meeting point before hand.

**Wristband collections will take place between 12:00 and 13:00 at the Regent’s Park meeting point near Gloucester Gate.**

We have a list of those registered to attend, and will distribute wristbands during this period. 

If you have not registered in advance, but want to attend, we will distribute any remaining wristbands between 13:00 and 13:30.

#### T-shirts and dress code

We have produced t-shirts for all attendees on the day. You don’t have to wear this if you don’t want to — but it’s strongly encouraged! 

We have already emailed those registered to attend with details for collecting t-shirts in advance. If you do not collect your t-shirt in advance, we will bring it with us on the day.

If you are registered to attend, we have already asked you what size you need. **You do not need to contact us about this**.

You can, of course, wear other outfits; but you should remember that you are the public face of the Civil Service at this parade, and you should dress appropriately for this.

#### The theme

The theme for this year's Pride in London is "Pride Jubilee", commemorating 50 years since the riots at the Stonewall Inn in New York.

When we think of "jubilee", we think of The Queen — so we're encouraging everyone to accessorise like royalty as part of the group. Again, you don't have to, but it'll be fun!

#### The float

We will have a float and walking group in the parade. We asked you which group you wanted to be in as part of your registration.

Around 20 to 30 people will be able to safely be on the float, but more than 40 people said they wanted to be on the float. To ensure everyone gets a fair chance to take part, the float places will be allocated randomly in advance and you will be told if you should go on the float when you collect your wristband. 

The float is a flat-bed lorry with two 7 metre video screens (one on either side of the vehicle) and a large centrepiece. We won't spoil the surprise, but it looks awesome!

**You must not get on or off of the vehicle whilst it is moving.** If you are asked to join the float, you must get on and stay on the float for the entire parade. Due to the necessary construction of the vehicle, the float is unfortunately not fully accessible. Additionally, be aware that there is no seating on the float. 

**Do not lean on or touch the electrical equipment or barriers surrounding the vehicle, and do not lean on or sit on the centrepiece of the vehicle.** They are fragile and you will be liable for any damage caused.

**You must not bring any drinks onto the float.** This is for safety reasons. Additionally, anyone who is intoxicated will be denied access to the float for safety reasons.

**You must not bring any large bags or other items onto the float.** There is no storage space on the float and those who are on the float will have only 2 minutes to collect their things when we reach the end of the parade before the float drives back into live traffic. Additionally, you must not take banners or placards on to the float for safety reasons.

**You must not smoke or vape if you are on the float _at any time_.** This is very, very important. The float's screens and music system are powered by petrol generators and you might cause a fire.

#### The walking group 

The walking group will walk directly behind the float. You may carry departmental banners or placards as part of this group. We will also provide a range of banners and placards for you to use.

**Please do not alter the designs of our placards or banners with markers, paints or stickers**. They need to be re-used at other parades across the country.

#### Your conduct

All civil servants and guests must abide by the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code) and the [Pride in London Code of Conduct](https://prideinlondon.org/parade/code-of-conduct/). Anyone that breaches these codes will be immediately asked to leave the parade by us or by Pride in London staff.

#### Social media

We encourage you to share your experience on social media with us.

Please take photos and videos and send them to us [@cslgbt](//twitter.com/cslgbt) on Twitter and [@civilservicelgbt](//instagram.com/civilservicelgbt) on Instagram, and use the hashtag #CivilServicePride. 

> **Help us out**
> 
> We need a few more people to help us carry placards and banners over to the parade area at the start of the day, and return them to an office at the end. If you can help, email <info@civilservice.lgbt>. 

#### Prepare for the weather

We expect the weather to be around 24 degrees Celsius, sunny with some cloud[^1]. There is around a 20% chance of rain throughout the day. Remember to wear suncream and bring plenty of water with you.

You should ensure that you bring plenty of water with you and preferably a reusable bottle. Water dispensing points will available in the parade form up area, but they are not available on the route itself.

You **must not** bring any glass into the parade area: metal and plastic containers only.
