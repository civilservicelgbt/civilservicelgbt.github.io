### We are honoured to have won 'The Employee Network Excellence Award' at the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards 2020. A huge well done to our whole leadership team, regional reps and volunteers. We would also like to say thank you to our network members - this is as much your award as it is ours.  

The Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards 2020 took place virtually on Friday 4th December. There were a record 297 nominations for the awards this year, all of which showed how much inspiring and innovative work is making a difference across the Civil Service. All of the winners from the awards will now go forward to the D&I category of the Civil Service Awards in February 2021, where they will form the category shortlist.

#### From the leadership team: 

The awards this year really showcased the amazing and outstanding work that civil servants do to help each other. As you know, diversity and inclusion is at the forefront of the Civil Service LGBT+ network’s agenda and it was great to hear about what other staff networks, individuals and teams are doing across the civil service on supporting this. More importantly, it was clear to see that through collaborative work we can help the civil service be the most open, fair and inclusive employer. We hope that over the next year we can continue to support LGBT+ civil servants in the best way we possibly can and work together with other staff networks on joint initiatives.
 
We know this year has been tough for so many of us, and even in these difficult, busy and stressful times we have stuck together as a network of volunteers and continued to deliver – for that, we offer our greatest thanks.
 
We also want to extend our congratulations to all the other winners and nominees – it really does show the inspiring and innovative work that takes place in our workplace. We look forward to virtually seeing everyone at the Civil Service Awards in February.

Ed, Jordon, Rikesh, Kate, James, Marc, Leah & Astrid
