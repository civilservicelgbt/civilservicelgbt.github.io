## PrideON - we're looking for volunteers

Despite the cancellation of many Pride events across the country due to Covid-19, your Network is determined to keep PrideON for the Civil Service and are looking for volunteers to get involved. We are looking to deliver a series of digital events & content across the month of June for the Civil Service.

There has never been a more important time for LGBT+ civil servants to stay connected and celebrate our community. Being a CS LGBT+ Network PrideON volunteer will give you the opportunity to contribute and lead on cross Government events and material for Pride 2020.

We are looking for volunteers to help plan PrideON, if you are interested please register your interest [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIskbjOvcJbx3h8WNq8lLzwnS_umrj7-FFP2udLSrkP2FuXg/viewform) no later than Friday 8th May along with ideas for events & content.

We welcome any interest, whether you’ve got graphic design skills, love planning events or just want to help out and become more involved; your CS LGBT+ Network would love for you to be an integral part of PrideON and look forward to hearing from you.
