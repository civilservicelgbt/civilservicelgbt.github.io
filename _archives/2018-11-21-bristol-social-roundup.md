On Tuesday 6th November the first, of what will hopefully be monthly, Civil Service LGBT+ network socials in Bristol took place. 

It had been nearly 2 years since an organised LGBT+ social took place in our amazing city so we were all excited to get together. Around 25 people joined us from a range of government departments across the city, including Ministry of Defence, Environment Agency and Cabinet Office to enjoy some very casual drinks and food at a pub that offers a discount for Civil Servants – which we were all, of course, delighted at.

I’d like to thank Dorion and Richard for organising and ensuring that the event was warm and welcoming to everybody under the LGBT+ banner, and for kickstarting what will hopefully be a very active LGBT+ network in the South West.

If you’re in Bristol or the South West join us for our next monthly social on Wednesday 5th December. You can find the details on the [Civil Service LGBT+ Network website](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2018-12-05-bristol-social/).

You can also [join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2409606785735978/) for updates and events.
