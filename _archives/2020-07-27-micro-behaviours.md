At Civil Service Live in 2019, the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion team ran a workshop on LGB&TI inclusion. This included a video of civil servants talking about the micro behaviours they experience which make them feel excluded.

These are real civil servants, talking about their real experiences - the sorts of things that civil servants are experiencing right now. 

Take a look at the video, and encourage colleagues to take a look, to understand some of the everyday behaviours which impact on LGB&TI people in the workplace.
