## LGBT+ History Month - February 2021

Despite another national lockdown, more home working and endless Microsoft Team calls, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a:gender are dedicated to remaining on its mission to continue virtually supporting all LGBTQ+ civil servants across the country, and to ensure that colleagues have access to resources and materials that will encourage their educational empowerment and allyship amongst our growing family and within the workplace.

We are excited to announce that we are commemorating our community’s history through an annual month-long celebration this February 2021 of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer history. 

We have partnered up with fellow civil servant and a qualified historian in Queer Heritage, Dr Jonah Coman from Social Security Scotland and his incredible network of historians, who are each equipped with the impressive and intriguing knowledge and experience to deliver such valuable sessions that will surely leave you asking for more.

Following on from an initiative that was created in 2005, educators and activists Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick organised LGBT History Month in the UK as part of a Schools Out UK. Such a programme existed to teach young people about the issue’s members of the LGBT+ community face on a daily basis, and to make schools feel inclusive for everyone, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

Every February, LGBT History Month is marked by schools, colleges and various organisations across the country, who seek to increase young people's awareness of the LGBT+ community through education.

LGBT History Month provides us with inspirational role models, builds stronger and supportive communities and represents a civil rights statement about the astounding contributions of the LGBTQ+ community. So, honour those who have come before us and raise awareness of the work we still have left to do. The fight for equality is far from over!

So grab fuel up the flux capacitor in your DeLorean, jump into your Tardis or grab your time vortex manipulator as we journey through periods of queer history and explore the past like you have never experienced before!
