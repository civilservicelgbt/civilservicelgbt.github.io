excerpt: An update from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.
---

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network hopes all our members are looking after themselves during this time. Please continue to follow [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) and [NHS](http://https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/) guidance.

Transport for London has partnered with Headspace to give people two months free access to their content. To find out more, please visit their [website](https://www.headspace.com/tfl). If you have any good resources on keeping mentally and physically healthy over the next few months, please [send](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) them to us and we will look to share them wider. 

You will have seen that many prides around the country are being postponed during this period. Therefore, the leadership team are looking at ways we can continue to celebrate events, mark key days and support our causes digitally. If you have any innovative ideas please [let us know](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt)!

## Social Media 

If you haven't already, please follow our social media channels to keep engaged. We are looking at using these more in the coming weeks: [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/civilservicelgbt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cslgbt), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/civilservicelgbt). We also have a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/civilservicelgbt/?ref=pages_profile_groups_tab&source_id=1407804409469176) that you can request to join. 

## Online events 

Is your departmental network hosting an online event that is open to all civil servants? Please [let us know](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) and we will share it on our website.
