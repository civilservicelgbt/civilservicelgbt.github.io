The anniversary of the Stonewall riots, and the start of pride season, is right around the corner. That means it's almost time for our annual season of events to kick off inside the Civil Service.

Last year, the **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** took pride online. We led the Civil Service’s first ever, all digital pride season. Hundreds of people took part, meaning we could all still commemorate and celebrate despite the pandemic.

This year, things look brighter and we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to restart some of our in-person events and socials across the UK soon. But we thought last year’s pride activities were pretty great! We were thrilled to have the work of our network of volunteers recognised as part of the [Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Awards](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/12/10/Diversity-and-Inclusion-Awards-2020). We want to build on what we learnt from last year. That's why we're keeping Pride On, again!

For Pride 2021, we'll be putting on a new season of events and encouraging you to take part in pride online. We've got lots of ideas to make this year's PrideOn bigger, better, and prouder than ever before. 

## Where can I find out what's planned?

We've set up a dedicated [#PrideOn page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/pride-2021/) on our website. We'll be adding all the details of our upcoming events and activities there in the coming weeks.

## How can I help?

If you'd like to help us put #PrideOn, [register your interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpy4PZmVTkzexU0wKcnrswQMzWGThR-pusrB3kYglNFfo9bQ/viewform) by 5 May 2021.

## What about pride marches and parades?

In consultation with the chairs of departmental LGBT+ networks and departmental LGBT+ champions, we have decided to focus our efforts on PrideOn this year. 

Pride is a big undertaking to organise for us, and we want to get it right. We won't be centrally coordinating attendance at physical pride marches or parades in 2021. We hope to be a bit more back-to-normal for 2022.
