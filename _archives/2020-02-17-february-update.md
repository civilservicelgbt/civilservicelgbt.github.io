excerpt: An update from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.
---

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network has a new team of vice chairs. In the coming weeks, we will be sending out an update to introduce ourselves, explaining our roles and priorities for the next year. In the meantime, please check our website for the latest events happening across the Civil Service. You can also find a readout from the latest [Leaders of Networks Forum](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/2020/02/17/leaders-of-networks-forum-readout), that took place on Thursday 4th February. 

To contact us, please email us [here](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt). We look forward to meeting you and working with you in the future.
