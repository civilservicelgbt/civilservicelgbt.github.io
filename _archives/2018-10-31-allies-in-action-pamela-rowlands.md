## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

I work for HMCTS in Cwmbran as a contact centre operator.
 
## How long have you been an ally?  

I joined as an ally late last year.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

I think it is important to be an ally as the need to be able to support against adverse opinions and to also to be able to assist somebody to be comfortable in their own skin, to be who they really are.

## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

I have asked the trainers to advise all the new starters that I am available as an ally if they need a friendly ear or any support, and have also informed the current staff.
