> Registrations are now closed for the Civil Service group at Pride in London 2019. If you entered into the lottery, we will contact you about whether you do or do not have a place by 6 June 2019.

This year's Pride in London will be the biggest one yet, and we're organising the Civil Service group in the parade.

Spaces are limited this year — we will have around 100 spots — so to ensure that everyone gets a fair chance to take part, we're allocating spaces through a lottery.

**If you want to join our parade group, you need to register by 14 May 2019.** To register your interest, [complete the registration form](https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9) and make sure you tick 'London' when asked which events you want to attend.

**Please note:** This registration form may be blocked on some departmental IT systems -- if this is the case, you should try to access it on another system, like a smartphone or your home computer.

Once the lottery closes, we will allocate spaces to ensure there is a good mix of people from different backgrounds and departments in the parade. We will be allocating places by 1 June 2019. You will be emailed confirming your place.

## Questions

### T-shirts and placards

We have secured funding to provide free t-shirts and merchandise to attendees. We will contact individuals about this once places are allocated.

### Partners, children or other guests

We can't guarantee entry for partners, children or other guests in the parade. Each person takes up a slot — and we have less spots to give out than last year.

This is a Civil Service group — our priority is to allocate places to current civil servants

### Swapping a place

If you want to give your place to someone else, that's fine. Just email us telling us before the event.

### Other questions

If you have questions about this process, you can email <info@civilservice.lgbt>. Please note that this inbox is staffed by volunteers and we get a lot of email -- it might take a while to reply to you.

**Only email us to ask for updates if the event you want to attend is less than 2 weeks away and you haven't heard from us.** The more emails we receive, the less time we have to organise things for you.
