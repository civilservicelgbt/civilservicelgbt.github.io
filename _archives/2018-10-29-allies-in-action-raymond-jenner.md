## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

I am the Squadron Quarter Master Sargent (SQMS) for 63 Works Group Royal Engineers.

## How long have you been an ally?  

I've been an ally for about 6 months.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

I think it's important to be an ally because even with society moving towards a non-prejudice climate, there are still barriers to individuals feeling accepted and comfortable being who they are.  Allies are just one way to demonstrate an organisations commitment to creating an environment free from discrimination, and also to promote diversity.

## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

I have ‘Ally’ on my signature block and I distribute the monthly newsletter across my work place. I also have notice boards displaying posters, information, newsletters along with the Army’s Diversity policy and my information as the lead Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Officer for my work place.
