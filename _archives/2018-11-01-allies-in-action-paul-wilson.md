## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

My job role is currently ‘Head of Technical Services’ within the Defence Infrastructure Organisation; I lead a team of dedicated deep subject matter experts in a wide and diverse portfolio of disciplines from Engineering; Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Fire, Building Standards. Occupational Safety and Wellbeing. Environmental Protection; Environmental Planning, Ecology, Forestry, Historic Estate and Scheduled Monuments, Sustainability. And Security; Electronic Security Systems, Access Control, CCTV and Physical Security (Barriers and Fencing) and Security Furniture.
 
## How long have you been an ally?  

I have been the DIO LGBT Network Champion for about 18 months, but consider I have been an informal ally for much longer.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

It is really important to have LGBT+ allies, both in the workplace and society, for their active and visible support to individuals, colleagues and events to help break down any misplaced stereotyping, barriers or indeed discrimination towards individuals or groups, and to challenge inappropriate behaviours when they occur.  As a Champion it is also vital in providing senior support to colleagues who may be experiencing discrimination or be subject to inappropriate behaviours.
 
## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

I actively support Cross Government, MOD and DIO LGBT+ events; and indeed, Diversity and Inclusion events in the round.  For example, this year I have participated / attended the DIO D&I ‘Lived Experience’ event; the sh…OUT Annual Conference in London; the recent DWP run ‘OneTeamGov LGBT+’ event in Manchester; along with many other local events.  I am a member of the DIO SCS Reverse Mentoring Programme, and finally, I am also an active member of the DIO D&I Steering Group and LGBT+ Network (as Champion).
