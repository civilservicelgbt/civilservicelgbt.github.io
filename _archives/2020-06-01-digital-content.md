A huge part of Pride is telling stories of the LGBT+ community and being visible. We want to know: 

- What does Pride mean to you? 

- Why intersectionality matters?

- How are you celebrating Pride this year?

We want to run a series of blogs and vlogs answering these questions, so please email [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) to get involved.

If you would like to write a vlog or blog or anything else, please send it over.

#### Coming soon: our PrideON Podcast and PrideON Playlist. 

> PrideON is a programme of digital events and content across the month of June to help celebrate Pride in the Civil Service. Do you have a digital event or content that you want us to share? [Contact us](/about/contact-us/).
