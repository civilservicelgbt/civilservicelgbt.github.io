50 years ago this month, a riot at a bar in New York — the Stonewall Inn — sparked a LGBT rights movement, and kickstarted annual pride protests around the world. This year, we're once again taking part in pride events across the UK — and celebrating this important milestone.

## Take part in Prides across the UK

We've secured funding to take part in 6 pride events across the UK, organised by us at the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. They are:

- [Edinburgh](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-06-15-pride-in-edinburgh/): 22 June 2019
- [London](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-06-pride-in-london/): 6 July 2019 (Currently full)
- [Newcastle](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-07-20-northern-pride-newcastle/): 20 July 
- [Belfast](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-03-pride-belfast/): 3 August 2019
- [Cardiff](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-08-24-pride-cymru-cardiff/): 24 August 2019
2019
- [Preston](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2019-09-28-pride-preston/): 28 September 2019

Some departmental networks are also organising attendance at other pride events, including:

- Liverpool: 27 July 2019

You can register to attend these events by [completing our registration form](https://forms.gle/23Trq8wuLa7VroJJ9). All events, except Pride in London, still have spaces and registrations are open until 2 weeks prior to each event.

> If you're organising a walking group at a Pride event, and it isn't listed above, please [contact us](/about/contact-us/) and we'll be happy to add it to our website.

### T-shirts, banners and placards

If you are joining us at one of the events listed above, we will be able to provide you with a Civil Service Pride t-shirt, free of charge. We will email you to ask for your size and your address around 2 weeks before the event.

We will also be able to loan banners and placards to you if you're organising a walking group at these locations or elsewhere. Just [get in touch](/about/contact-us).

## An inclusive place to work

For Pride this year, we're reminding everyone why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work.

### Share your story

This Pride season, we want you to share your story. Write a blog post for us, and tell us what an inclusive Civil Service looks like to you.

Send your blog post and a picture of yourself to us at <info@civilservice.lgbt>. We'll post as many as we can over the next few weeks.

### #CivilServicePride

You can show your #CivilServicePride on social media too. 

Share your pictures from Pride events, and tell us why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work.
