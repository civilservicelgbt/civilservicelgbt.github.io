## What’s your job role and where do you work? 

DWP Personal Independence Payment Disputes Resolution Team Case Manager at Newport, Wales.

## How long have you been an ally?  

I've been an ally for 10 years.

## Why do you think it's important to be an ally, and to have allies within an office?  

I think that there is still a lack of understanding about the struggles faced by people in the LGBTQ+ community. I think it’s important for them to have people to support them and help spread awareness and understanding.

## What have you done to be a visible ally within your office or what do you plan to do? 

I wear my rainbow lanyard. I attended the PRIDE event in Cardiff. I am waiting for a meeting with senior leadership to discuss ways to raise awareness and I discuss it within my team on a regular basis.
