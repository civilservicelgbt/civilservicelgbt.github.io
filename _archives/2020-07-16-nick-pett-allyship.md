#### Nick Pett is a Senior Civil Servant and a LGBT+ advocate 

My allyship is a promise to LGBT+ people.  It is an offer of love and friendship.  

It is the commitment to willingly use my time and energy to understand historical and present-day hatred, violence and discrimination towards LGBT+ people.  

It is the guarantee that I will listen to you in order to understand your lived experiences.  It is the desire to read, listen to, see and be with you.  

It is the promise that I will use that learning to help build a more inclusive life, workplaces and society.  

I will carry my allyship with me wherever I go and you will be able to see it and hear it wherever I am.  

I will speak out against phobic behaviours, cultures and people.  

I will critically analyse the policies, practices and outputs of my employer, and work to understand and respond to potential and current developments in society and internationally. 

I will work hard to educate fellow straight people and to help others to become allies. I will celebrate you, support you, and defend you.  

I will do my best to never let you down. I am hugely proud to be with you
