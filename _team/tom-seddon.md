Hi, I’m Tom (He/Him) and I’m delighted to be part of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network!

I currently work in the LGBT team in the Government Equalities Office, Cabinet Office. As part of this role, I lead on LGBT education, data and monitoring. Before joining the Government Equalities Office, I was a Policy Advisor in Defra. Prior to joining the Civil Service, I taught at a primary school in West Yorkshire.

In all of my roles, I have been involved in a range of LGBT+ networks, and I was previously Chair of Teach First’s LGBT+ Network. I’m keen to support our LGBT+ colleagues across the Civil Service, to ensure everyone is able to bring their ‘whole selves’ to work; I’m particularly keen to support the career development of LGBT+ Civil Servants – whether that is through mentoring, careers events or at our upcoming 2022 conference.

I look forward to meeting you soon!
