Hi there – I’m Rachael (she/her). 

In my day job, I’m the Observational Research Team Leader at the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (part of the MHRA). I’ve been involved in the LGBT+ mentoring scheme both as a mentor and a mentee, and am passionate about supporting civil servants to develop their careers whilst being authentic to themselves. 

Outside of work, you’ll typically find me rolling dice (D&D DM), shooting arrows (archery beginner), or cooking up some vegan treats!
