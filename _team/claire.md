Hello!
 
I'm Claire and I joined the Civil Service in January 2021. I first started at DHSC in NHS Test and Trace working on Covid. Currently, I'm at an ALB within the Home Office working as an analyst in counter extremism. 
 
I have been involved in the Civil Service LGBT+ network since my first CS role, where I volunteered as a panellist to talk about intersectionality. I am also a mentor in the LGBT+ mentoring scheme. I volunteered as Vice Chair of Minority Ethnicity because I want to increase visibility, awareness, and engagement across the network and within it. I intend to create a safe environment for CS staff who identify as LGBT+ and minority ethnics where everyone can meet, network and learn more about this community and to work with networks across the CS to ensure cohesion.
