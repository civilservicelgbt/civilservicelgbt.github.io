Hi my name is Ian. I’m originally from Hartlepool but been a proud resident of Salford for the last 12 years. I currently work in DTS as part of the DDaT Capability and Engagement team. The job is all about developing our people, not just in terms of technical skill but also raising awareness to make sure we have an inclusive workforce and people feel they have a voice, which provides me with a lot of job satisfaction.

I am passionate about inclusion and learning from each other. I believe it is important to be visible and to role model the right behaviours allowing an environment where people can feel comfortable to be themselves. I have been an active member in the SPIRIT and HMCTS Pride networks so see this is an opportunity to do more on a bigger scale and I look forward to the challenge. I love the idea of meeting people around the whole country and sharing ideas and that sense of community.

Random fact about myself is I’m obsessed with Jane McDonald. I even went to the Jane McDonald holiday in Rhodes this year with all the superfans. It was a holiday of a life-time and she performed 4 of the nights and there was huge LGBT+ presence on the holiday so felt a bit like a pride event. I still remember as a little kid watching her on the BBC show The Cruise which is back on iPlayer if you wanted to go down memory lane. I’m also a proud cat dad my boys are called Keith and Colin.
