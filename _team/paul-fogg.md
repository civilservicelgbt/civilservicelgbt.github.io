Hi, I'm Foggy.
I work at HMP Manchester as a Patrol Dog Handler and have been in service for 30 years.
My journey with my sexuality has been a very private one, until fairly recently. I'm Bisexual, happily married to my wife and I have an 18 year old daughter from a previous marriage. 

My wife has known about my sexuality for around 3 years but was the only one. Since publicly "coming out" or as I prefer to say, "letting others in" about 2 years ago; I have been a "walking rainbow" both at work and in my home life. 

I love that I can be open and honest about who I am, in all areas of my life. I actively promote LGBTQ+ socially and in work whenever I can; and try to bring awareness to those who are lacking understanding. I hope I can help, inspire and walk with others on their path to being who they truly are.
