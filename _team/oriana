I work within HM Revenue & Customs within a wonderful and welcoming team. I identify as a lesbian and am a partner to a trans woman. 

I am keen to help develop more safe spaces (physical and virtual) to socialise and learn across the Civil Service network. I am looking forward to making our social events more inclusive and relevant for everyone in the LGBT+ network. 

When out of office I enjoy teaching yoga in my local community space, swimming outdoors and visiting new cities to experience new foods.
