I'm Jefferson Welsby, one of two Co-Chairs of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. 

Iï»¿ have worked in the Civil Service for over 10 years. I started my career in HM Prison Service back in 2010 operationally. After leaving HMP I secured employment with then Thomson Airways (now TUI) before returning to the Civil Service in 2015, joining the Department for Work and Pensions where I have remained since.

Saorsa-Amatheia and myself have already had the pleasure of working together as previous Co-Chairs of DWP's LGBT+ Staff Network, DWP Pride for 2.5 years. We both have a strong desire to make a difference to the lives of LGBT+ people.

We're really keen to encourage members to branch out from their Departments. Whilst the CS LGBT+ Network is already a vibrant and exciting network, we want to increase that! Please get in touch to share your thoughts, idea's and innovative ideas for the network, ultimately, this is your network!
