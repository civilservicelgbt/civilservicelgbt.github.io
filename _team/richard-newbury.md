I am currently working as an Operations Manager in Disability Services within DWP and DWPride regional lead for Wales and Northern Ireland. I joined the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and volunteered to be the regional lead for Wales. I have been in the Civil Service for 18 years but I would always hide my sexuality. After becoming the first Mr Leather Wales back in 2016 I decided that it was important for me to be who I am in the workplace as well as outside of work. I feel itâ€™s important that we bring our whole selves to work. I also have a passion to see cross government working to ensure that the Civil Service is a great place to work.
