Having worked in the private, public and third sectors, I finally became a civil servant in 2000.  I have identified as bi and trans since I was very young and, more recently (when I finally came across the word) as pan.  In 2018, I joined the Welsh Government LGBT+ Network, PRISM, as our (first ever) Bi representative. I run a long term change programme in Welsh Government and I am interested in how we can all adapt and develop in ways that fully appreciate the beauty and strength in human variety.
