Hi there - I’m Ciarán (He/Him/They) and I work on food policy. 

As Regional Organiser for Northern Ireland, I work to support LGBTQ+ civil servants to connect with each other and create a more diverse, inclusive, and equal place to work for LGBT+ civil servants. 

Feel free to reach out for a chat.
