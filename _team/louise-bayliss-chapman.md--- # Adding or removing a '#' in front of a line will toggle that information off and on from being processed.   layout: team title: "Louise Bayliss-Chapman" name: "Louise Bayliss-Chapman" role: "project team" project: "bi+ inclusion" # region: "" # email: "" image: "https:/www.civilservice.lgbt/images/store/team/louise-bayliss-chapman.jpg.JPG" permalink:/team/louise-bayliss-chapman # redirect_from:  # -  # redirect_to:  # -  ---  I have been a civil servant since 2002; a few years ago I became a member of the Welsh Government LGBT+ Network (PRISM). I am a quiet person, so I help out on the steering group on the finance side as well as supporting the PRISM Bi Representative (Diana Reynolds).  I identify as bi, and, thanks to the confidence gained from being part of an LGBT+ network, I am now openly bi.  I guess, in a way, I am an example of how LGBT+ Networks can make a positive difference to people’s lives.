I have been a civil servant since 2002; a few years ago I became a member of the Welsh Government LGBT+ Network (PRISM). I am a quiet person, so I help out on the steering group on the finance side as well as supporting the PRISM Bi Representative (Diana Reynolds).

I identify as bi, and, thanks to the confidence gained from being part of an LGBT+ network, I am now openly bi.  I guess, in a way, I am an example of how LGBT+ Networks can make a positive difference to people’s lives.
