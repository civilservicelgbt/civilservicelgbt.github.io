I work for the Rural Payments Agency in Exeter and am a member of the DEFRA LGBA&T Network. I am currently the Asexual Lead for BiSpace, a position I volunteered for after experiencing aphobia outside the workplace. I am committed to improving visibility, acceptance and inclusion for everyone in our community, and have supported this in the Civil Service by creating the first cross-government Asexuality Fact Sheet. Hopefully this resource is one of the many to come to raise the profile of asexuality.
