I work as a Project Manager in the Homelessness & Rough Sleeping team at MHCLG which is my first role in the Civil Service. I volunteered for the CS LGBT+ Network after attending the Government Equalities Office's National LGBT+ Conference and feeling empowered to make the Civil Service a more inclusive place for LGBT+ colleagues. I really hope that through the Network Iâ€™m able to help make Government a more inclusive place to work for minorities.
