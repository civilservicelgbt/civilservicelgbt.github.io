I’m Anna and I lead on women’s inclusion in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

I’ve been in the Civil Service for about three years and currently work in strategy. I’ve been involved in LGBT+ stuff and women’s stuff for many years, so volunteering here makes sense for me. I’m really interested in wider inclusion in LGBT+ spaces.

I’d love to hear from network members who want to get involved with women’s inclusion! I live in Manchester with my partner and our cats and like hiking, swimming outside and reading.
