I joined the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in early 2007 as Administrative Officer in the International Liaison Branch and have progressed via a range of roles, more recently to be Assistant Director (Grade 6) Ship Standard since January 2018. I am based at the MCA HQ in Southampton. In Autumn 2019 I helped launch LGBT+ Network within the MCA.  The MCA is a relatively small organisation with a wide geographical footprint (1500 employees spread from Cornwall to Shetland), therefore I really recognise the value of making connections beyond the organisation with others in the wider Civil Service as within the Maritime industry.
