In my day job I work in the Ministry of Defence within in the Finance and Military Capability Strategy team. I joined the Civil Service as an Apprentice in 2016 first working in the DfE on the Academies programme prior to joining the MOD in 2019. 

I have been attending events put on by the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, or CSRA as it was at the time, since I joined the Civil Service, finding these a great place to meet other civil servants and network. 

Given the disruption we have all faced due to Covid Iâ€™m keen to help support the network in getting events and socials going again. If you have any ideas for future socials please let me know!
