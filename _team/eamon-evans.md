In my day job I work in the Ministry of Defence within in the Finance and Military Capability Strategy team. I joined the Civil Service as an Apprentice in 2016 first working in the DfE on the Academies programme prior to joining the MOD in 2019. 

I have been attending events put on by the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, or CSRA as it was at the time, since I joined the Civil Service, finding these a great place to meet other civil servants and network. 

Given the disruption we have all faced due to Covid I’m keen to help support the network in getting events and socials going again. If you have any ideas for future socials please let me know!
