I’m currently a Policy Advisor in the Cities and Local Growth Unit. I started volunteering for the CSLGBT+ network when I joined the Civil Service in 2018 as part of a project team. I look forward to driving forward exciting projects as a Vice Chair and helping facilitate the best collaboration amongst all our networks – to ensure the Civil Service offers the most inclusive experience for us LGBT+ people. I also oversee all our communications, the website and our social media pages. Outside of work, I volunteer for a LGBT+ charity, enjoy exploring new places and finding a good last minute deal on theatre tickets!
