Hi!

Iâ€™m David, and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a real treat for you to be learning more about me, because Iâ€™m *quite a big deal* ðŸ˜Š

I work for the Scottish Government, juggling policy across both the LGBTQI+ and Gender Equality Teams. Not all heroes wear capes, some are just *very* committed to advancing equality for marginalised groups! Iâ€™m really keen on bringing as many LGBTQI+ civil servants together, as I know it can sometimes feel a bit lonely working in such a massive organisation like the Civil Service. Networking, to me, is more than just a method of advancing your career; it allows us to connect on a deeper level about the ups and downs of our jobs through an LGBTQI+ lens and make life long connections. Working with my other Scotland local organisers, I hope weâ€™re able to bring as many people in the Civil Service as possible.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me being down bad crying at the climbing gym (little riff on a Taylor Swift song, for those that know); questioning all my life choices running around parks; and finding inner peace (and my hamstrings) at my weekly hot yoga classes.
