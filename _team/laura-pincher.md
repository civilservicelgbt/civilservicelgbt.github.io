Hi, I’m Laura (she/they). I’m originally from the West Midlands, but based in Manchester since September 2022 when I returned home from 6 years in Japan and joined the Civil Service. I’m keen to get more involved in the community in Manchester and the North West, and to support the already well-established community here in as many ways as I can.

I love to organise/plan things (mostly holidays, but also group outings on a smaller scale), so here’s hoping I can use those skills to help bring about some enjoyable events for the North West – and I’m always happy to chat, so feel free to get in touch whenever if you’ve got ideas, or just want a natter.

In my spare time, you can often find me wandering the footpaths & fields of Cheshire/outer Manchester – or if the weather is terrible, cooking sweet & savoury treats in the kitchen.
