Hi my name is Ady and I joined the Civil Service in April 2016. I first started in Work and Health, at Haywards Heath JCP as a Work Coach, following this I moved to Tonbridge JCP, where I was the LGBT+ SPOC. I now work for CMS in Hastings, on the Service Centre Support Team.

I am passionate about LGBT+ representation and inclusion. Iâ€™m an advocate for colleagues to be treated fairly by both customers and colleagues. Up until last year I was the chair of the local UCB group and Wellbeing Lead. I believe that everyone has the right to work in a safe environment and I like to ensure the happy and friendly face of Ady, is always here to speak to.

A few random facts about me, I love musicals with Sunset Boulevard being my absolute favourite. I have two Chihuahuas called Dot Dot and Belle, in addition to this I am active member within the community working hard for the benefit of all the towns residents. I started an organisation in 2015 that raises money for young LGBT+ adults who are unable to live at home any longer. This funding is used to help them live independently and safely.
