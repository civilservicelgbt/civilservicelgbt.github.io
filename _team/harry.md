Hello! I am Harry, great to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ Before you ask, I was named before the books âš¡

I have been in the Civil Service for a while, across many departments, but currently I support policy across HMRC as a Policy Specialist (imagine an internal consultant). My day job aside, Having supported many a Civil Service LGBT+ network both socially and on committees, I am keen to use that experience to create spaces for interactions, meet and greets and community socials around me. I hope, in joining the network, that I can support people in Scotland and meet some lovely folk along the way.

Outside of work, I like the odd bit of camping, a pub trip, video games, and being active! If you are ever wandering the Edinburgh office and want a chat, then feel free to get in touch ðŸ˜Š
