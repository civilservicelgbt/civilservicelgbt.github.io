Hello! I am Harry, great to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ Before you ask, I was named before the books âš¡

I have been in the Civil Service for a while, across many departments, but currently working in the policy space. My day job aside, I am keen to facilitate more community socials, and meet the lovely folks in Scotland while supporting the wider LGBT+ Network.

If you have any ideas for events or wanted a chat, do reach out ðŸ˜Š
