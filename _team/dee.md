Hi, I'm Dee (she/her) and I am part of the Civil Service HR Function. 

I'm passionate when it comes to HR and believe that it's the people that make the Civil Service great! 

As a cis queer woman of colour I recognise the importance of authenticity and the significant role intersectional inclusion plays in enabling people to be their authentic selves at work, and excel at all levels across the Civil Service.  If you can see it, you can be it! 

I'm super excited to join the Network leading on career development and look forward to putting my HR skills to good use so that whatever their career aspirations, all LGBT+ staff can thrive at being the best version of themselves.
