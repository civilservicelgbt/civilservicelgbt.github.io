Having worked for the UK Government’s Crown Commercial Service for over ten years, I am now on a two-year secondment as Border Communications lead in the Welsh Government, where I am also the Bi Rep for their LGBTQI+ network, PRISM.

My pronouns are she/her and I’m primarily based in Cardiff.

I wanted to get involved in LGBTQ+ organising to ensure all our staff felt safe and supported in being out at work. The Civil Service is so vast and wide-ranging in the UK that we can have a huge impact on workplace norms, and I think it’s so important that we take the responsibility to do so.

And with a bit of luck, we can have some fun while we’re at it - so if you’ve got an idea for a social, please let me know!
