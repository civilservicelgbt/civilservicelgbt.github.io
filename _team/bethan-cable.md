I am currently working as Research and Digital Content Operations Manager for the Crown Commercial Service, based in Cardiff and Newport. I'm also the vice chair of our LGBTQ+ network, *Pride in CCS*. 

I've been part of the Civil Service for nearly nine years now - I wanted to get involved in LGBTQ+ organising to ensure all our staff felt safe and supported in being out at work. The Civil Service is so vast and wide-ranging in the UK that we can have a huge impact on workplace norms, and I think it's so important that we take the responsibility to do so. 

And with a bit of luck, we can have some fun while we're at it - so if you've got an idea for a social, let me know!
