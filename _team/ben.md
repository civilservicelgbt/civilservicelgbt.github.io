Hi, I’m Ben (he/him), I joined the Civil Service in late 2024, and I’m thrilled to be helping Katharine as one of the CS LGBT+ representatives here in Bristol.

In 2025, I had the honour of marching in the Bristol Pride Parade, proudly representing the Civil Service for the very first time which was an unforgettable experience that deepened my commitment to visibility and inclusion.

When I’m not gaming, you’ll likely find me experimenting in the kitchen, cooking is one of my biggest passions, and I love sharing good food with great company.

I’m excited to support the work of CS LGBT+, champion our community, and help foster a space where everyone feels seen, heard, and celebrated.
