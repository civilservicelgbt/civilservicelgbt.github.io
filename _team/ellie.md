I’m Ellie (she/her) and I first joined the Civil Service in early 2021. I’m a fierce advocate for the LGBT+ community and believe our differences and diversity make us stronger together. In my day-to-day job I am a member of the Government Risk Profession, and regularly get involved in my ALB’s various staff networks.

I’m excited to play my part in ensuring the Civil Service remains a great place to work for LGBT+ colleagues. In 2024 I was proud to volunteer at Bristol Pride with the CS LGBT+ network and will always fly the flag for allies and friends! I live with my partner and my dog, and outside of work I like to spend time cooking, in nature, or on a crafty project like cross stitch or macrame.

Please contact me with any queries or if you’d like to get involved with our work in the Allies/Allyship space.
