Hi there, I’m Ross (he/him) and I have been in the Civil Service since September 2014. In my day job I work in taxes as well as support my department's PRISM Network. I have been involved in my departmental network and the Civil Service LGBT+ Network for a few years now.

I hope that my involvement in both networks helps to create a safe space and friendly face for everyone, making sure that LGBT+ representation is increased and celebrated. Learning, education and growing is key to this.

Outside of work I love to travel and am a huge fan of deep/progressive house and trance. I try my best to spend my time around incredible people with positive attitudes, all living their life to the fullest.

From Bi Visibility to Barolo and airports to Anjunabeats, don’t hesitate to get in touch for a chat.
