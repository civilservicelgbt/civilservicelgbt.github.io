As Vice-chair for Digital Events and Community, I lead on how we engage with our members online through events and build an online community. I hope to meet and speak to many of our members through my time in this role.

I'm currently the Planning & Reporting Lead for Building Digital UK (BDUK), part of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport. I have led many of the online events within BDUK over the last two years including the creation of our 'Digilympics', a series of online events to keep staff engaged when not being able to work in the office. I am based in Manchester our after spending almost 4 years in London.

I'm a massive foodie & film lover, so you'll mainly be seeing me posting some terrible food on Instagram or enjoying the newest blockbusters.
