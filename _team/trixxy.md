Trixxy is the CS LGBT’s Network’s Trans, Intersex and Non-Binary lead, and Co-Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority’s Rainbow Network, alongside her day job as the CMA’s Strategy, Complaints & Enquiries Manager.

Her role in the Rainbow Network sees her lead a fantastic team who work to support, promote and celebrate the CMA’s LGBTQ+ staff and their allies, maintaining the CMA’s respectful and inclusive environment for all colleagues. Trixxy transitioned in March 2022, and credits her safe and supportive working environment in the CMA as a large part of helping her live authentically.

Her mission as part of her role with CS LGBT is promote and advocate for the same safe and supportive workplaces across the Civil Service, which celebrate their trans colleagues and allow people to bring their whole selves to work.

In her spare time she enjoys socialising, shopping and suffering as a life-long fan of Middlesbrough Football Club.
