Hello, I’m Scott (he/him) and started with the Civil Service in February 2020. I currently work part of a 24/7 IT Operations Team for the Department for Work and Pensions as a Senior Analyst and Shift Lead. Whilst being based in Manchester half of the team I manage also work in Newcastle.

As an out and proud gay man I’m determined to champion and be an advocate for diversity and inclusion, I want everyone to feel they belong and can be their true self. Supporting DWP Pride I attend events and consider myself an ambassador for the departments network. My aim is to continue building the great relationships and network we have in the North West region along with making many new friends and connections along the way far and wide!

When off-shift I enjoy going on walks and attending Zumba classes, music has always been a huge part of my life and the 80s has got to be up there as my all-time favourite era even if I am a 90s baby. Along with attending gigs, festivals, and club nights I’m a huge fan of the theatre and love a good musical. My door is always open so please don’t hesitate to get in touch be it a catch-up and chat or ideas for the network.
