I work as a Diplomat in the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office and live in Egypt with my wife Vicky. I identify as bi+/fluid/questioning/nondefining and am Bi+ representative for the FCDO FLAG Committee. I also head the FLAG Africa Hub and joined the Civil Service Bi+ Inclusion Team in 2020. Iâ€™m passionate about supporting those with complex sexuality, orientation or identity.
