I'm Chris (he/him) and I work at the DfE in the Skills Crisis response team, leading on 16-19 Mental Health policy. I previously was the Vice-Chair of the Fast Stream LGBT+ network and look forward to continuing to champion LGBT+ inclusion in this role, focusing on refreshing governance structures and strengthening our relationships with departmental networks. Outside of work I enjoy reading sci-fi, theatre trips and a good park run!
