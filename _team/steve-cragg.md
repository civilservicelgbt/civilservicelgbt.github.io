I'm Steve and I'm a very recent addition to the Civil Service.  I joined DWP in July 2021 at EO grade working in legacy benefits and Universal Credit.  

I have a background in sales and management, having previous run my own business providing sensory equipment for users with sensory impairment.  A long-time participant in LGBT events (with a performance in a Steps tribute band under my belt!).  

I'm a firm believer in equality and inclusion and I hope to support and encourage my LGBT colleagues wherever I can.  In the past I have helped to organise local pride events (before they became so big!) and was active in my LGBT group at Manchester University.  I look forward to helping out wherever I can!‚Äù
