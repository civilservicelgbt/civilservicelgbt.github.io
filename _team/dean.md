Hi there, I'm Dean, a trans man who moved to Edinburgh back in 2023, and I'm excited to be a representative of CS LGBT+ here alongside Karen.

Previously I lived and worked in Cork, Ireland for 15 years in customer support for a major computer gaming company and gaming is still a big part of my life. It's through it I met my partner, who I moved to live with.

I was also the local LGBT+ network chair in the company which gave me so many opportunities to support my colleagues and the community in general. We organised involvement in the local Pride parade, social events and lean-in meetings as well as decorating the office for Pride month. It also gave me chance to connect with fellow members of the network all over the world, from Portugal to Brazil and the US.

Beyond gaming, I love crafting and often have at least two crochet projects on the go among other creative endeavours. I also love board and tabletop games and enjoy going along to our building-wide board gaming group!

I look forward to supporting the efforts of CS LGBT+ and being a supporter and advocate for all we do and the community we share.
