In my day job I work at the Foreign Office, overseeing foreign policy matters relevant to the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. I joined the Civil Service in 2014 and have also worked at DfE, the Government Equalities Office, and the Wales Office. London is one of the most LGBT+ friendly cities in the world, and here in the capital our Civil Service network is already well established. But there is always more to do, and Iâ€™d love to hear about any new ideas for events and socials.
