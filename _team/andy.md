I’m Andy, and I’m really excited to introduce myself as one of the new Scotland reps for CS LGBT+ Network!

A little about me – I’ve been with HMRC for 11 years, currently working as a Private Secretary. I'm passionate about promoting inclusion and wellbeing in the workplace, and I believe in creating an environment where everyone feels valued, supported, and empowered to thrive. After 6 years as HMRC’s PRISM Network Glasgow rep, I’m looking forward to moving into CS LGBT+ Network and bringing that same energy and commitment to this role, working alongside others to help build a strong, supportive community across Scotland and the UK.

Personality-wise, I’d say I’m approachable and always interested in new ideas. I really value open conversations and making sure everyone feels heard and represented.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me with my football team, on or off the pitch. I’m secretary, coach and player for Saltire Thistle, an LGBT+ inclusive football team. We play up and down the UK and recently won 2 Football vs Homophobia awards. When I’m not playing or watching football I’ll be spending time with my dog, a 3 year old cockapoo called Theo. I’m always up for connecting over shared interests – so don’t be a stranger!

I’m looking forward to meeting more of you and getting stuck in. If you’ve got ideas, questions, or just want to say hello – feel free to reach out!
