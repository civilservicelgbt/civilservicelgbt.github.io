I’ve worked in a variety of roles in the Civil Service, across D&I, HR, Project Management and IT, I’m currently working in Civil Service Employee Policy which is part of CSHR. I’ve been involved with LGBT networks for almost as long as I’ve been a civil servant, setting up and chairing a departmental network in the past and chairing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network now. I’m passionate about diversity and inclusion and feel very strongly that we should be able to bring our whole selves to work. I’m also very aware that something that makes a team stronger is the diversity of its members, whether that team is the CSLGBT+ Network Exec or the whole of the Civil Service.
