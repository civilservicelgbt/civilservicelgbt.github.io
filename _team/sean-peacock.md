Hi! I’m Sean, a User Researcher working on the Planning Reform programme in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. I’m based in Newcastle upon Tyne, but frequently travel across the UK. I joined the department in October 2021, and this is my first Civil Service role. Outside of work, I study part time, and I’m currently completing a PhD that’s involved working in schools and youth groups. 

I also volunteer with a Scottish charity that enables young people to thrive. I’m really excited to be supporting the network’s efforts in the North East of England, ensuring we have good representation locally and nationally and helping to build a varied and inclusive programme of events.
