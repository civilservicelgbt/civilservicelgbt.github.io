Hello.  I’ve been in the Civil Service for almost 16 years, in different organisations and parts of the country, starting at Jobcentre Plus on a fixed term contract, moving on to the DVLA in Wales, and then coming to live and work in beautiful Scotland at HMRC Glasgow, and now Edinburgh office.

Prior to joining the civil service I’ve been a holiday camp entertainer/compare, mushroom picker, ran a pub in Brighton for a while, and worked at a delicatessen where I honed my love of great food (and drink), amongst other things.

I’m a pansexual, disabled, neurodivergent, intersectional person, who believes all people have a right to exist comfortably and safely in their own skin without having to explain themselves, or worse, excuse their existence, to anyone.

I love theatre, music, particularly live music, reading, mostly sci fi and high fantasy, board gaming, in person and online, and getting out and about to interesting places and exhibitions when time, health and finances allow.

Please never hesitate to come to me with queries or issues; if I don’t have an answer to hand, I will make every effort to find it. I look forward to meeting, and speaking with you at events both in, and outside work.
