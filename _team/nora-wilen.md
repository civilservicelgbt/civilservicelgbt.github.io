Hello there! My name is Nora (she/they) and I joined the Civil Service in January 2021. Iâ€™m based in Birmingham, and I work in the Briefing and Stakeholder Engagement team within the HMPPS HQ. Outside of my day job, I have an energetic ragdoll kitten Nala and a flat full of plants that keep me busy. I also enjoy exploring new restaurants and cosy pubs with good craft beer. 

Since I joined civil service during the second national lockdown, it has been a challenge to meet new people and network with other civil servants. I joined the Civil Service LGBT+ Network to meet new people I can connect with and to get more involved in the community, to help everyone feel included and welcome. I look forward to utilising my background in event organisation, and I welcome any suggestions, ideas and feedback at any time.
