Hello! Iâ€™m Jack and work in HMRC in Liverpool. Ive been in the Civil Service since 2017 doing all kinds of different roles, most recently working in the Strategy directorate working on coordinating the tax compliance priorities which manages to keep me quite busy!

I am very much a people person and also love a holiday, and so most often spend time outside of work seeing friends and family and booking little trips away. I also love food and while im not the best cook in the world, I am always tryingâ€¦ ðŸ˜Š 

I have been part of the network for quite a while now, and really like how it is genuinely such a warm, friendly place and really hope I can help make a positive contribution going forward!

Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch for a general chat or even to discuss some new ideas!
