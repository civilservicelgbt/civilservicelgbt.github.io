Hi, I’m Matt (he/him) based in Manchester though a Lincolnshire boy
originally and I have been in the Civil Service since October 2017. I
have been involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network for a few
years now organising the Manchester socials and working with Ross
to create the North West network.

I make rainbow awareness ribbons to promote diversity and support
work based events, so please contact me if you would like any, these
are free and happy to send as many as you need.

I love to meet people though I am an introvert and the socials have
opened up a new friend base and support network I could not have
imagined, so pop along and say hi.

My favourite quote is from Lily Tomlin which is “I always wondered
why somebody doesn’t do something about that. Then I realised I was
somebody.”
