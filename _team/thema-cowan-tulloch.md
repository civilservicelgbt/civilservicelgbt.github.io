Hello I’m Théma (pronounced Tay-ma) my pronouns are She/They. I joined  the Department for Education just at the start of the Pandemic as an EO. Prior to DfE , I was working as an AO at HMRC. I believe it’s really important for me to be active in the network as a Lesbian and Black Woman. I currently live in  Nottingham with my partner and cat. When I am not working, you can find me painting Warhammer Miniatures.
