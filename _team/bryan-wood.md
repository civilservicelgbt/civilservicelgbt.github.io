I joined the Civil Service at Warbreck House in Blackpool, working on the Kickstart Programme. 

I’m now working for Disability Services and enjoy it very much! I’m based in Blackpool, having lived around the Morecambe Bay area all my life (apart from a short foray into Yorkshire, but I’ll draw a veil over that!) For me equality of all kinds is essential to make the world go round and will always champion and support causes when ever I can. 

I’m also a theatre nerd, and can often be found up ladders with a hammer or messing about in grubby theatre cellars! I’m looking forward to working with the Civil Service LGBT+
