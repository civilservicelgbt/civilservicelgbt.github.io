Hello there!
 
I’m John, and I’m currently a Policy Advisor for the Department of Health and Social Care working in the Covid-19 Strategy Directorate, and I joined the network not long after I joined the Civil Service. As we enter (hopefully) a less busy period of Covid, I decided I’d like to volunteer in the network. I am looking forward to working across the network that makes the Civil Service a more inclusive place for LGBT+ civil servants. Outside of work, you’ll probably see me in a terminal at Gatwick or drinking cocktails. I also happen to volunteer as a Governor for an Academy.
