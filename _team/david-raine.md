Hello! 

I am relatively new to the Civil Service having joined in November 2020. I work as a Case Manager for the Department for Work and Pensions, based in Bristol. 

I am thrilled to be a part of the LGBT+ Civil Service team and I am looking forward to getting stuck in, meeting everyone, and getting to know more people from different departments.
