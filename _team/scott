Hello, I’m Scott *(he/him)* and started with the Civil Service in February 2020. I currently work as a Senior Technical Operations Manager part of the Hybrid Cloud Services team in Digital for the Department for Work and Pensions. I started with the department as an IT Operations Analyst, progressing to a Senior IT Operations Analyst before moving teams into my current position and all roles have been Manchester based.

As an out and proud gay man, I’m determined to champion and be an advocate for diversity and inclusion, I want everyone to feel they belong and can be their true self. Supporting DWP Pride *(DWP’s LGBT+ Network)* I have always attended events and considered myself an ambassador for the network. I also became the networks Secretary in December 2023 so form part of the committee. My aim is to continue building the great relationships and network we have in the North West region along with making many new friends and connections along the way far and wide!

When off-shift I enjoy going on walks and attending Zumba classes, music has always been a huge part of my life and the 80s has got to be up there as my all-time favourite era even if I am a 90s baby. Along with attending gigs, festivals, and club nights I’m a huge fan of the theatre and love a good musical. My door is always open so please don’t hesitate to get in touch be it a catch-up and chat or ideas for the network.
