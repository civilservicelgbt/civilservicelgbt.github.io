I’m Faz, Vice Chair for ethnic minority inclusion – where we discuss all things race and within these
different areas of our intersectionality’s.

I wanted to be Vice Chair for focusing on ethnic minority group inclusion as it is sometimes the most
visible characteristic of an individual. This combined with identifying as LGBTQI+ can be a very
challenging experience but also a very enlightening one too. My intersectionality’s have allowed me
to be more compassionate, empathetic and confident in myself. This was a long journey to say the
least and this space is for those who are on this journey – no matter where you are – you’re
welcome :)

My favourite book is The Ministry of Utmost Happiness by Arundathi Roy – captures the experience
of an individual who experiences the pre and post partition in India through the lens of their intersex
experience - their journey through life as a young girl, navigating sexual and gender identity in a very vibrant and ever-changing India. A MUST READ!

I’ve recently started to enjoy colouring (colour by number of course), I love exhibitions, museums,
galleries, documentaries and anything that will grow my knowledge. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss awareness
workshops etc :)
