Hello there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m John.

In my day job, I am the Assistant Director for Market Oversight and Integrity in the Office for Digital Identities and Attributes, part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.

Prior to my current role, Iâ€™ve worked in a number of departments, including the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport where I was a Bill Manager, the Government Equalities Office where I was Head of Sexual Orientation policy, and the Government Digital Service.

In 2021, I designed and led the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme. This is the first and only mentoring programme of its kind within the Civil Service, matching thousands of LGBT mentors and mentees across government, giving access to career development and role models. It won the 'Developing and Supporting People Award' at the 2021 Civil Service Awards. In my current role with the cross-government network, I'm continuing to lead the programme â€“ now in its third round.

Whilst I continue to be engaged in the network supporting mentoring activities, I've previously been the chair and vice-chair.
