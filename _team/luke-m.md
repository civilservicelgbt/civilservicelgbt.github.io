Hi everyone, my name’s Luke and I have been in the Civil Service since April 2022. In my day job I work in Governance, Risk and Assurance in MoJ as well as that I’m the co-deputy chair of the HMCTS Pride Network and Wellbeing and Visibility Lead.

Wellbeing is something I’m incredibly passionate about and within the last year have organised, along with my team, a series of initiatives such as monthly LGBT+ Wellbeing Newsletters, a Pride Virtual Steps Challenge, a Contact for Kindness page which is an online Teams Community where people share wellbeing resources, things that they enjoy or have a general chit chat and, LGBTea Call Drop-Ins to try and tackle isolation for LGBT+ people across the organisation. I think it’s important to understand how different everyone’s journey is and to create that space of support where people feel comfortable to be who they are and feel connected to others.

Outside of work, I am most likely on a long walk, painting, crocheting, or reading a good book! Anything with a soppy gay storyline is right up my street.

I’m looking forward to expanding these initiatives across the Civil Service now in my role within the CS LGBT+ Network so please feel free to get in touch for a general chat or if you have any ideas for the network.
