Hi, I’m Emily (she/they) and I am based in Newcastle as a Business Support Officer with the Office of Health Improvement and Disparities within DHSC. I’ve been aware of the network for just over a year, although I haven’t gotten as involved as I would have liked due to the pandemic changing things for everyone. When I saw that regional meet-ups were happening, I figured it was a great time to get involved and meet new people in my region.

For some background, I have a kitten called Arthur, I need 2 cups of coffee before I open my laptop in a morning, and I’m passionate about equality and social justice across all walks of life. I also ran my University’s LGBT+ Society for a year (with roughly 250 members) so I am no stranger to the unique challenges of organising LGBT+ friendly social events, but I am always open to suggestions for anything new.
