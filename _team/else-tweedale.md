Iâ€™m Elsa Tweedale and I am one of the Vice Charis for Parents, Carers & Partners. This is a group to support Parents, Carers & Partners of LGBT+ people in the workplace.

I work within the DWP as a Disability Employment Advisor. I am also a trade union rep, a menopause ambassador and a subject matter expert and support officer for people experiencing or surviving domestic abuse.

I became involved within the DWP LGBT+ Network as an ally and a partner of a trans woman. My wife transitioned many years ago and during that time I went through my own roller coaster of emotions, confusion and grief. I know that this can be a very difficult time of trying to give support to your loved one whilst also struggling yourself.

I am here to listen and offer my help as much as I can to you throughout the civil service so If you are feeling lost and are needing support please come and join us for our very informal, friendly coffee and chats each month and join our MS Teams chat. You can either email me directly or the parents carers partners network on the email above.
