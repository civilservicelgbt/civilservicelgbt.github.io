I joined the Civil Service in September 2020 working within HM Revenue & Customs in the Debt Enforcement Team.

I started attending Civil Service socials just to network with the hope of finding other LGBT+ civil servants. With London, being so diverse in people and cultures I thought the events run by the network are perfect to go to. 

In my personal life I’ve taken part in LGBT+ causes and events, whilst the network has done great thus far, I do think there are areas to improve. I want to use my experience to help promote and get the involvement of more women, trans and non-binary colleagues into the network and attend the array of events on offer.

In my free time, I am a pilot and I love to fly around the country and sometimes overseas. This has given me to chance to; visit many countries & take in the various cultures on offer, I’ve made great friends and let’s not forget trying the food (I’m a massive foodie).
