Hi, Iâ€™m Sam and I currently work as the Senior Private Secretary to the Director of Commercial, Vaccines and Countermeasures Delivery at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). I joined the Civil Service in January 2019 as a policy advisor in MHCLG, and then moved to operational and operational policy roles in NHS Test and Trace before joining UKHSA.\
\
I have had the privilege to work in multiple parts of the country over my career and I am extremely passionate about bringing the best out of our diverse workforce and ensuring that individuals are able to succeed regardless of their background or characteristics. Diversity comes in many forms and I am committed to supporting the LGBT+ community across the Civil Service in both the London region and beyond.\
\
Outside of work I enjoy hiking, football and the gym. I also love to travel, meeting new people and experiencing places that are different to those I am familiar with. Please reach out if you have any questions or need any support.
