I currently work within the Chief Finance Officer Group of HMRC. I’ve been a civil servant since 2018 and in that time, I’ve worked across three government departments. I’ve been involved in each LGBT+ Network across the departments I have worked in and I’m currently a Steering Group Member representing the East Midlands, for PRISM (HMRC’s LGBT+ Network).

I take great pride in being a civil servant and serving the public to the best of my ability, but I am also passionate in helping ensure the Civil Service is a great place for everyone to work in. 

As Vice chair – Governance, I work to support the Networks governance and operations. My first project will be to ensure an effective review of the Network's constitution takes place in March 2022.

I look forward to meeting and working with everyone!
