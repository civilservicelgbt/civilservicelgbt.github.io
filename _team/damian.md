Hello there! My name is Damian and Iâ€™ve been in the Civil Service for over 20 years now. I know, I donâ€™t look old enough! I started as a casual AA back in 1996 and now Iâ€™m an EO working for Attendance Allowance. I am a gay man.

Outside of work, I was originally from Preston but now live in Kirkham. Â I consider myself to be a huge geek! Love gaming, Sci Fi, films. Big Kate Bush and Tori Amos fan but love music in general. Â I live with my cat, Tina, who can be a handful! Like to go out and visit friends. Tend to be shy and quiet at first but I open up once I relax. Â Iâ€™m hoping to get a nice ground together for the Preston and Blackpool and arrange various for people of all backgrounds.Â  Let me know if you have any ideas! Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜Š
