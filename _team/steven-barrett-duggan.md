Hi, I’m Steven, I currently work in HMRC as Strategic Customer Manager in Borders & Trade based in Benton Park View. I support some of the UK largest traders to ensure goods flow in and out of the UK smoothly and support with any Customs issues. I have worked in HMRC since 2008 starting straight from school, as I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do as a career. I have since worked in a number of different roles over the years from include Operations, Policy and Project Delivery. 

Outside of work, I live in Hebburn, South Tyneside with my husband and Sprocker Spaniel Lily, who is always ready to go for long walks down the coast and country with her ball! We also love any holidays in the sun and try to have as many as possible if funds allow. 

I enjoy meeting new people, listening and learning from their experience and is one of the key reasons why I want to support the Northeast Civil Service LGBT+ Community. I am hoping in the coming months we can boost social events and attendance.
