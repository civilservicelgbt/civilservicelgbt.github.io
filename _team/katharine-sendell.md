I joined the Civil Service in 2015 as an apprentice working on the Civil Service Jobs website. Having such a small Cabinet Office presence in Bristol made it easier to be part of the core Civil Service LGBT+ network than the Cabinet Office one, so along with Andrew Cowler I became a regional organiser and rep for the south west region of the network in 2018. I've loved seeing our little community grow in numbers, and meeting and having the opportunity to work with so many colleagues from different departments has been amazing.
