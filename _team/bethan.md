I've worked for the UK Government’s Crown Commercial Service across a wide variety of roles for thirteen years now (I know, even though I don't look a day over eighteen!), where I was the founder and now a vice chair of their LGBTQ+ Network, Pride In CCS. I'm recently returned from a two-year secondment to Welsh Government, where I was the Bi Rep for their LGBTQI+ network, PRISM.

My pronouns are she/her and I’m primarily based in Newport and Cardiff.

I wanted to get involved in LGBTQ+ organising to ensure all our staff felt safe and supported in being out at work. The Civil Service is so vast and wide-ranging in the UK that we can have a huge impact on workplace norms, and I think it’s so important that we take the responsibility to do so. I'm also a huge queer history nerd, so LGBTQ+ History Month is always busy for me as I shamelessly take the excuse to raise money for charity by talking about my special interests ;)

As Wales rep, I'm always happy to find an excuse for a social - whether that's a cinema trip, the theatre, arts and crafts, or the regular Cardiff Payday Socials. So if you’ve got an idea for an event, please let me know!
