I am a Fast Streamer on the Statistics stream, posted at MoJ this year, and the Bi/Pan Champion on the Fast Stream LGBT+ Network. You may also have seen me around MHCLG (2023-24), GLD (2022-23) or UKHSA (2020-22). I was a civil servant prior to the Fast Stream, I promise I’m not so bad they held me back! :D

Growing up in an environment that didn’t exactly encourage expressing ‘unconventional’ sexual orientations and identities, I get unreasonably excited whenever I see anything rainbow-coloured. I've been going to LGBT+ Network events since I joined the Civil Service in 2020. But since I am rather outspoken about LGBT+ and my identity, I often come across other members of our community that rarely engage with networks and events. I hope I can help organise some that will give them a space they feel welcomed into.

My take on anyone not 'comfortable' with LGBT+ topics: if my grandma can figure it out, no one else has any excuse.
