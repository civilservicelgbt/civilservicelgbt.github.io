Hi everyone, my name is Ted (he/him) and I have been in the Civil Service since August of 2020. My current day job is working as project support where I lead on a few different portfolios including Mentoring and Recruitment. Shortly after joining my department, I got involved with our LGBT+ network as a local steering group representative for Northern Ireland and I am delighted to take on a wider reaching role now within the CS LGBT+ Network.

Outside of work I have a few different hobbies like going to the gym and surfing. I also go to circus school where I am learning a load of different skills, but my favourite is the aerial acrobatics. Iâ€™m also a part time bar tender.

I watch a lot of TV & Film and have previously studied in this sector gaining qualifications in TV & Film Production, Editing and Post-Production and Special Effects and Media Makeup. I like all things Sci-Fi and Fantasy so enjoy watching Marvel, DC, Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings content and all of the prequels, sequels and spin offs.

Please feel free to get in touch for a general chat or if you have any ideas for the network.
