Hello! I’m Michael, Vice chair of the BiSpace.

Currently, I am a Senior Delivery Advisor within Defra leading on movements of plants, seeds potatoes and used agricultural machinery as part of the Windsor Framework. I have been a Civil Servant since 2012, working across various roles and professions within HMRC, Insolvency Service, DWP, and now Defra.

As a Bi man, I am aware of the misconceptions, stereotypes, uncomfortable conversations, and erasure regarding Bisexuality. I am dedicated to making change within the Civil Service to create a positive and safe working environment for LGBT+ staff, especially for those that are Bisexual, Pansexual, Asexual and Aromantic 

In my spare time, you will find me powerlifting, watching anime, playing video games, and attempting (poorly) to do graphic design and drawing.
