In my day to day I am a Senior Policy Advisor, leading on Northern Ireland Governance within DEFRA. I am responsible for ensuring DEFRA’s interests are represented in EU working groups and committees along with meeting reporting requirements. I have worked in the Civil Service for 10 years, starting my career as an Assistant Officer then promoted to Compliance Officer within HMRC and later as a Case Manager within DWP. I have always been passionate on creating a more welcoming and inclusive working environment. This led me to becoming actively involved as a PCS Trade Union Representative across the Civil Service.

As a bi man, I have always been aware of the preconceptions and stereotypes of the Bi community. I feel it’s important to work together on making changes both inside and outside the Civil Service.  I look forward to working with other like-minded individuals and making that difference.
