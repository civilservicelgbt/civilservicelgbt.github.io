I’m Clare Hannah (they/she) and I’ve been in the Civil Service since 2014. I am currently the Area Lead for Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire, in the Cities and Local Growth Unit, which is a joint BEIS/DLUHC unit (yes, it’s a mouthful!). I am involved with the LGBT+ network in BEIS and previously in DCMS and MOD.
 
Having moved up to Birmingham in 2020, I wanted to get to know other local LGBT+ civil servants and given there was no regional lead for the West Midlands I decided to put my hand up to help build a supportive community for those of us in the region.
 
Outside of work, I volunteer regularly with Birmingham Slow Food; and enjoy reading, playing board games, and building Lego.
