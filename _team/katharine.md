I've been a regional lead for the South West since 2018 organising and hosting socials and other events for our fabulous community of civil servants. In my day job, I work in digital delivery at the Cabinet Office and am based in the amazing city of Bristol.

My hope and aim is that every LGBTQ+ civil servant in the South West (and beyond) feels safe, seen and supported by the CS LGBT+ Network and has a community they can rely on.

If you have ideas for events, want to get involved or just want to talk more about what we do in the South West, don't hesitate to get in touch!
