Iâ€™m Alan (they/he). I joined the Civil Service in 2014.

I have been involved in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network since early 2020, when I joined the Bi+ Inclusion Team. At the end of 2021 I was appointed Vice Chair for trans and non-binary inclusion. My goal is to ensure that all trans and non-binary civil servants feel included, valued and supported by the Network.
