Hi everyone, I’m Derek and I’m honoured to be your Rep for Scotland/Glasgow Region again.

I have worked for the Civil Service/HMRC for 41 years and counting and have been a member of CS LGBT+ since 2003 when it was previously known as the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance. I was the Chair of the HMRC PRISM LGBT+ network from 2014 to 2020 and have lots of experience organising work, social and Pride events. I have also attended many Pride events in all 4 nations of the United Kingdom as well as World Pride in New York and European Pride in Amsterdam.

It is very important for me to be a visible role model to help make a difference to LGBT+ people of all ages and I also like to encourage everyone to ‘be yourselves in everything you do’ and ‘bring your whole selves to work’. Difference should be celebrated; wouldn’t the world be a boring place if we were all the same.

I live with my husband George, 21 years and counting, and my African Grey Parrot Mac, or Mad Mac as we call him as he never shuts up.

Outside of work I am a massive foodie as I am so lucky that my husband is the most amazing Head Chef. I am a very passionate football fan; I won’t say which team though lol. I am also a bit of a thespian (I said thespian!), just love the theatre and I also love travelling.

I just adore people, so please feel free to contact me for a chat, I would be delighted to hear from you.
