I’m Derek and I am honoured to be HMRC LGBT+ PRISM Network Chairperson. I live near Glasgow with my husband George, together for 17 years, our African Grey parrot ‘Mac’ and our 2 cats Dolce & Gabbana.  Employed by HMRC since 1983, based in Cumbernauld where I am a manager in Debt Management.  I believe it is important to be visible and lead from the front. I am always actively involved in Pride season, leading my LGBT+ friends and colleagues at Pride events all over the UK as well as playing an active role in organising events for key LGBT+ dates.
