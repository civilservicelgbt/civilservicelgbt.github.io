Iâ€™m Martin and I work for the MOD at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick as a Military Secretary Clerk.  I have been with the MOD for more years than I can remember and have held several different jobs throughout the UK and overseas including floating around the world with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.

I was born in County Durham and have lived in Teesside for most of my life and am reluctant to leave this unique and friendly area.  I love meeting new people, making new friends and enjoy nights out, listening to bands, hill walking, cycling and of course Pride events.

My degree is in Social Science and Social Policy and I am passionate about diversity and inclusion and in particular government and social policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues. 

I am keen to organise social and other events in the Darlington and Tees Valley area, especially with the expansion of the Darlington Economic Campus, so please get in touch if you have any ideas and potential venues or if you just want to chat.
