I'm Jonathan (he/him): a cross-government drifter and proud member of OneTeamGov. I've worked across most of the big departments, and spent some time in the private sector. I'm a software engineer by trade, and I've been working with John on improving the way we run our mentoring program to make it faster and more efficient.
