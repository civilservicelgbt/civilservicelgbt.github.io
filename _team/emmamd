I'm Head of Inclusion at the Department for Work and Pensions. I joined the Civil Service in 2018. In my first few weeks, I attended a BiSpace event in London and was inspired to meet so many bi+ civil servants and this motivated me to get involved in the bi+ committee. Since then I've created our bi+-visibility fact sheet, represented the civil service LGBT+ team at diversity and inclusion events, and organised a bi+-visibility & intersectionality event. I hope all these initiatives will continue to make bi+ civil servants like myself feel acknowledged and represented.
