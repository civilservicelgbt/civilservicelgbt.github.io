I have been a civil servant now for over three years and part of the Government Communication Service Flex Team at Head of Communications level. I am currently deployed to the UK Health Security Agency as part of the Covid-19 response, as Head of Business Stakeholder Engagement in External Affairs.

I’m really proud to be a civil servant and even prouder we have a thriving LGBT+ Network. I’m looking forward to getting stuck in and working with the team, meeting you all, and making the Civil Service the best place it can be to work.
