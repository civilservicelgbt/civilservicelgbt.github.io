I work in the Cabinet Office, and am both a Vice Chair and Bi+ Lead for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. I lead a small, dedicated team that promotes bi+ visibility and inclusion across the Civil Service, by running dedicated events, publishing resources, and connecting colleagues. By not falling neatly into either lesbian/gay, or straight spaces, bi+ people can find it difficult to come out and feel accepted or legitimised, even within the LGBT+ community. I wanted to volunteer my time towards ensuring all LGBT+ staff feel equally supported and represented, no matter how they identify.
