In my day job I'm the Head of Social Mobility for the Civil Service Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Unit, within the Cabinet Office, having previously worked at DHSC and DWP. I became a vice-chair of the CS LGBT+ Network because I want to ensure that our workforce has a recognised space and powerful voice on behalf for our LGBT+ community, no matter where you come from or what your identity is. I think the Civil Service is greatly underestimated by others in our expertise on LGB&TI issues, and I hope to help build our credibility as a centre of expertise within the U.K.
