Iâ€™m Marco and I work for the MoJ as a Legal Officer assigned to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) based in London. I decided to join the network and volunteer as a Vice Chair so I can help support the network in championing LGBT+ inclusion across the Civil Service, focusing on refreshing governance structures and strengthening our relationships with departmental networks. Outside of work I enjoy going to festivals, meeting up with friends and indoor cycling.
