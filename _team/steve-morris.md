I joined DWP in November 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Immediately I became actively involved in the West Yorkshire Diversity & inclusion community, organising various local events around LGBT Pride, staff wellbeing, and career progression for colleagues with protected characteristics. 



I am also an active member of the DWP Pride and the Change and Resilience Pride groups at work. I support colleagues as an Ambassador for Fair Treatment and form part of a small team from various directorates as an Executive Team Shadow Board member, which provides further opportunity to represent a unique viewpoint and champion progress around diversity and equality at the highest levels within the Department.



My guilty pleasures are apple crumble and wordle! On my downtime, I go to the gym, love eating good food and socialising. Iâ€™m excited to be joining the Network as Vice Chair and to work alongside everybody to make a difference to the communities we support.
