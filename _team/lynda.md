Hi, my name is Lynda Bradshaw and I am one of the Vice Chairs for Parents, Carers & Partners. This is a group to support Parents, Carers & Partners of LGBT+ people in the workplace.

I have worked in operational delivery in DWP for over 32 years as a Disability Benefit Decision Maker.

I have been married to my wife Tracey for over 7 years and we have 3 grown up children between us including a transgender son.

During my time as a strand lead for faith and belief as part of the DWP Pride committee, I realised we were missing support for parents, carers and partners of LGBT plus.

Despite already being part of the LGBT community ourselves, we had our own worries and struggles whilst trying to support him and needed our own support group to reach out to other parents, carers and partners without judgment.

The parent, carers and partners support group became a safe space for people to come and share and support once a month, many who have never had any connection with the LGBT community before.

If you, or know someone that may benefit from this support, please get in touch for further details.

Outside work my passions are music (I play the violin), camping (glamping) and attending different prides around the UK each year. I particularly love to support the first-time prides and attended Kirkhamâ€™s first pride this year.

I was previously the parade manager for Blackpool Pride for several years but I am now retired (the wife said she would divorce me if I did it again). It really is an all-year-round job despite being once a year!
