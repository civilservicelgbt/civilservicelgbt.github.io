Hello there 👋 I’m John.

In my day job, I am the Head of Digital Identity Governance, Policy and Delivery in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology; working to establish a new governing body for the digital identity market – the Office for Digital Identity and Attributes.

Prior to my current role, I’ve worked in a number of departments, including the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport where I was a Bill Manager, the Government Equalities Office where I was Head of Sexual Orientation policy, and the Government Digital Service.

In 2021, I designed and led the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme. This is the first and only mentoring programme of its kind within the Civil Service, matching thousands of LGBT mentors and mentees across government, giving access to career development and role models. It won the 'Developing and Supporting People Award' at the 2021 Civil Service Awards. In my current role with the cross-government network, I'm continuing to lead the programme – now in its third round.

I'm also the former chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. I was Vice-Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network from October 2017 to 2019, and from April 2021 to October 2021. And I've been leading major project work within the cross-government network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; helping to deliver our award-winning mentoring programme, Role Models guide and LGBT Impact Index, developing the network’s digital presence, and leading our Pride activities.
