Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m John, and Iâ€™m the Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. I took up the role in late 2021, and will be stepping away from the role in late 2023, making way for a new chair.

In my day job, I am the Head of Digital Identity Governance, Policy and Delivery in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.

Prior to my current role, Iâ€™ve worked in a number of departments, including the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport where I was a Bill Manager, the Government Equalities Office where I was Head of Sexual Orientation policy, and the Government Digital Service.

I was Vice-Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network from October 2017 to 2019, and from April 2021 to October 2021.

Iâ€™ve been involved in the cross government network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; helping to deliver our award-winning mentoring programme, Role Models guide and LGBT Impact Index, developing the networkâ€™s digital presence, and leading our Pride activities.
