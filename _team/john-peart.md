Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m John, and Iâ€™m the Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

In my day job, I am the Head of Design and Delivery for the Safe To Be Me conference being held in June 2022. Prior to my current role, Iâ€™ve worked in a number of departments, including the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport where I was a Bill Manager, the Government Equalities Office where I was Head of Sexual Orientation policy, and the Government Digital Service.

I was Vice-Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network from October 2017 to 2019, and from April 2021 to October 2021.

Iâ€™ve been involved in the cross government network since I joined the Civil Service in 2013; helping to deliver our Role Models guide and LGBT Impact Index, developing the networkâ€™s digital presence, and leading our Pride activities.
