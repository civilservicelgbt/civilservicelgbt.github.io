I joined the Civil Service in 2008, working in employment relations and more recently HR casework, and have been one of the ‘ambassadors’ for my department’s LGBT+ network since 2017. I really enjoy working with other networks on intersectionality and shared issues that impact on all underrepresented groups, particularly mental health and unconscious bias. I’ve been one of the local organisers in the South West since 2018 and it’s been great to meet colleagues from other departments. Working together on social events has built new friendships and I’m looking forward to growing our group in Bristol and beyond.
