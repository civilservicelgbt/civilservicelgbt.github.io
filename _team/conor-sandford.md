Hi, Conor here. I joined the Civil Service 'propper' in 2020 as a Senior Heritage Policy Advisor at the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, working primarily as an ALB sponsor and leading on various appeals casework.  

Prior to this I held various public and private sector posts, mostly concerning heritage protection (AKA 'old buildings'!).  My academic background is in Archaeology, Paleoecology and Geography (BSc.) and Heritage Science (MSc.) having studied in Belfast. Having spent 6 years in London, I have recently relocated to Northern Ireland where I hope to continue to champion a culture of diversity and inclusion at every level.  

In my spare time I can be found in a beekeeping suit or in a blacksmith's forge, between unpaid work as the Chair of a community organisation. I also currently hold a Public Appointment to the Northern Ireland Historic Buildings Council. Iâ€™m driven by 'making a difference'.
