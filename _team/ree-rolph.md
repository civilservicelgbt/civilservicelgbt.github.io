Hi! I’m Ree (he/him) and I recently joined the HMRC Surge and Rapid Response team in Edinburgh. 

I have a background working with volunteer and community organisations, focusing on communications and volunteer development for LGBT+ and environmental groups, so I’m keen to get involved supporting the LGBT+ community within the Civil Service. 

I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, historical, and non-fiction books and games, and hope one day to write some. If you want to suggest something to run in Scotland, are interested in helping, or just want to chat, please get in touch!
