Hi! I’m Sarah. I started working for the Department of Health in the middle of the pandemic on PPE policy. I’m now working on EU Exit policy, so it’s from one national crisis to another for me! I’m passionate about supporting LGBT causes. Being able to connect with other LGBT people has enabled me to turn a negative experience into a positive one. I helped revive and run an Oxford LGBT magazine called Pink Times, which originally ran in the late 80s as a response to the implementation of homophobic legislation such as Section 28. I’m now keen to help give LGBT Civil Service staff in my region a sense of community that will help them feel included, connected, and supported.
