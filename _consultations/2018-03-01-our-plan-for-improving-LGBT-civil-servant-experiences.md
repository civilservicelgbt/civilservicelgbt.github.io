## Consultation outcome

We used the information you provided as part of this consultation to create our [business plan](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/business-plan-2018-to-2020/) for 2018 to 2020.

## Consultation description

This week, we published [our plan for improving the experiences of LGBT+ civil servants: a consultation](/publication/our-plan-for-improving-LGBT-civil-servant-experiences/).

The consultation document sets out ideas for how the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance should evolve, and how its work should change.

Our first action has been to change the name of our network to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. The rest is now up to you: tell us what you think about our ideas and what you'd like to see done differently.
