## Consultation description

Trans people are able to receive legal recognition of their acquired gender through a process set out in the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2004. The Government say that, since the GRA came into force, only 4,910 people have legally changed their gender.

The consultation focuses on the Gender Recognition Act 2004 only. The Government is not proposing any amendments to the Equality Act 2010.
