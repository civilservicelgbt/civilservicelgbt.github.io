As the Civil Service LGBT+ Network prepares to launch the 2022-23 mentoring programme, we are keen to hear from mentors and mentees who took part in the 2021-22 programme. Your feedback will be used to develop and improve this year's mentoring programme.  

The survey will help us to understand more about your experiences during the programme, whether that be as a mentor, a mentee or both. In particular, we want to know whether the programme's initial aims were achieved. These aims were:

1.	Provide career development support to LGBT+ civil servants that they otherwise wouldn't have had
2.	Provide access to LGBT+ role models that mentees otherwise wouldn't have had

This is an anonymous survey. It should take about 10 minutes to complete.
