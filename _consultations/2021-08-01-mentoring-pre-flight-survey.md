## About this publication

This survey will help us to measure the impact of the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme.

You should only complete this survey if you have registered as a mentor or mentee on our [mentoring programme](/mentoring).

Mentors and mentees should complete this survey **_before_** they start any long-term mentoring.

## Before you complete the survey

Before you complete this survey, you should read [our guidance documents](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/about-our-mentoring-programme) so you know what to expect on the programme.

If the guidance doesn't answer your question, you can also email us at [mentoring@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mentoring@civilservice.lgbt).
