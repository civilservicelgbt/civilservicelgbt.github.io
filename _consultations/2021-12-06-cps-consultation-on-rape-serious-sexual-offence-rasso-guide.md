As part of the Crown Prosecution Service's work on rape and serious sexual offences, it has made a commitment to improve the information provided to victims, supporters and the public about how these cases are charged and prosecuted.

To meet this commitment it has produced three documents:

1. a guide for victims of rape and serious sexual assault
2. a commitment to rape victims
3. a policy statement â€“ how it charges and prosecutes rape cases

The CPS is seeking feedback on these documents. The deadline for receiving responses is 23 December.
