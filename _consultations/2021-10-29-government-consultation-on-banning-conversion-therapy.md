The government is consulting on how it plans to ban so-called 'conversion therapy' practices, which particularly affect LGBT+ people. This consultation will be open for 6 weeks, closing on Friday 10 December at 11:45pm.

The consultation seeks views on a package of proposed measures that will apply to England and Wales.

The consultation is being run by the Government Equalities Office and the Equality Hub. Please email <ctconsultation@cabinetoffice.gov.uk> if you have any enquiries specifically relating to the conversion therapy consultation.

If you have questions relating to the wider policies of the Equality Hub, please email <geo.correspondence@geo.gov.uk>.
