**Lots of Civil Service organisations have their own LGBT+ networks.** These voluntary networks provide access to support, career development opportunities, and a community of other LGBT+ civil servants like you in your area. This page lists the networks we know about and have contact details for.

**The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is one of many cross-government employee inclusion networks.** A range of other cross-government networks support staff who have different identities and protected characteristics. All cross-government networks collaborate with their local networks.
