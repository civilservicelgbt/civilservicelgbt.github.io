Civil Service LGBT+ Network 'Groups' are email distribution lists run by people in our local organiser team and programme teams. They are separate from [our email alerts which you can sign up to on our website](/join-us). Unlike our email alerts, Groups are a bit less formal and a bit more personal.

This page lists the groups that are available, and explains how to subscribe and unsubscribe to each.
