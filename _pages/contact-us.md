We aim to reply to most correspondence within a week, but please remember we are volunteers, doing this on top of our day jobs, so it sometimes takes longer for us to respond.

### Ask us to share your content

We are happy to publish content that you want to share with LGBT+ civil servants. This includes:

* blog posts
* news articles
* events
* publications

Send us an email at [chairs@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:chairs@civilservice.lgbt) and we’ll add it to our website.

We can’t accept all requests to publish content due to the voluntary nature of our network. Content should be relevant to LGBT+ civil servants as civil servants and adhere to the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).

### Hold a consultation

If you want to consult with our members on a particular issue relevant to LGBT+ civil servants, send us an email at [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).
