## Adding someone to the email alerts list

C﻿ivil servants can register for email alerts by completing a form at [www.civilservice.lgbt/email-alerts](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/email-alerts)

T﻿he visible form on the website is linked to a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_x2T2kG1vEhlca2dvYlv7c_EnmaC8EmWiFX43mzgh7ZA28Q/viewform) that is linked to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's Google Workspace account. T﻿he Google Form is linked to a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5hQQ_ejKvwZVDO1viFL3SwKmbE3VLj9VczGjmShHJ4/edit#gid=1174852171) document in the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's Google Drive. Every time someone submits the form, a row is added to the Google Sheet.

> ﻿ The form that appears on the website was custom coded so that it looked consistent with the rest of the site. If you change the Google Form, the website registration flow might break.

> ﻿ If you want to make changes to the forms, you should ask a developer familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript to help you.

## Removing someone from the email alerts list

You must remove someone from the email list if they request it. 

To remove someone from the list.

1. [Open the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V5hQQ_ejKvwZVDO1viFL3SwKmbE3VLj9VczGjmShHJ4/edit#gid=1174852171)
2. Go to the `Members` tab
3. Search for their email address
4. Highlight the row and delete the row from the spreadsheet

**Never act on a request if you cannot confirm the user is who they say they are.** Before you take action on their request, you should check that the person making the request is the same person that registered. You can do this by checking the email address from which the request was sent against the emails we hold.

## A﻿mending someone's information

**N﻿ever amend someone's details on the email lists directly.** It is very easy to make a mistake that might accidentally reveal personal data. 

I﻿f you receive a request from someone to amend their data:

1. Inform them that we do not amend existing information to ensure the integrity of people's data
2. Inform them that you will delete their existing information
3. Ask them to register again via the online form with their updated details

## S﻿end an email alert

W﻿e use GOV.UK Notify to send email alerts to people on the lists. 

**E﻿mail alerts are not the same as newsletters.** GOV.UK Notify is designed for "transactional" email – these are emails that are automatically generated in some way to \_notify\_ the recipient of activity they might care about; like new blog posts, a password reset email, and so on. Newsletters from staff networks tend to be discursive and informal. Email alerts are structured content that is sent in a semi-automated way. You must not send informal email via this system or you may be removed from the system.

You can use the [tools on the Civil Service LGBT+ Network website](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/tools) to generate the content of an email alert.

Before you send an email alert, decide who you need to send it to. This could be:

* everyone on the email alerts list
* a﻿ subset of people on the email alerts list, filtered by region, nation or interest
