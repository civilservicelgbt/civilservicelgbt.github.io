**He/Him**

**Officer of HMRC & PRISM Network Liverpool Lead, HM Revenue Customs**

**G7, Tax**

Ross started with HMRC in 2014 on their graduate programme. Once completing the course he became more involved in other aspects of HMRC life. In 2019 Ross joined HMRCs PRISM Network, where he is currently the lead rep in the Liverpool region, and the CS LGBT+ Network where he is one of the Local Organisers in the NW. Since joining the CS Network the local organisers in the NW have been busy maintaining a network of engaged people across a whole host of departments. They hold 3 socials a month; Liverpool, Manchester & Blackpool/Preston, as well as advertise awareness days, and events through their newsletter. This year's pride offering was the biggest the NW has ever seen, with 8 prides attended, as socials or marches. Hitting triple figures in Manchester Pride parade was certainly a highlight for the NW.
