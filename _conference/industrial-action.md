title: Industrial action on the national rail network
event: conference-2022
section: logistics
sequence: 2
---

Industrial action is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 5 October. This may have a knock-on impact to travel on Thursday 6 October.

We suggest you follow the latest guidance from National Rail and, if feasible plan, your journey around this. You should build in time for any potential delays.

If you had intended to travel on 5 October, you may wish to consider asking for permission to work from a London office on 5 October and instead travel on 4 October. Any approvals to do this would be for your manager and organisation to agree.

### If you are unable or no longer wish to travel

If your journey is affected by the train strikes, and you are unable to travel or no longer wish to travel, please cancel your place via Eventbrite. If you have any issues doing this, please contact <conference@civilservice.lgbt>.

We will be hosting a similar online-only conference event later in the year for those who are unable to attend in person.
