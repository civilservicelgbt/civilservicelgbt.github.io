A light lunch will be provided.

If you have any special dietary needs, please let us know in advance. It may not be possible to accommodate all requests for special dietary needs. Where this is not possible, you should rely on your department’s normal subsistence and expenses arrangements to claim back the cost of food or drink.

You are free to purchase your own refreshments and food on the day if you wish. The conference centre is located close to Strutton Ground where a variety of vendors are available. Speak to a conference volunteer on the day to find out where to go if you are unsure.
