**They/Their/ Them**

**Litigator, HM Revenue Customs**

**Grade 7, Tax and Legal** 

Cleo joined HMRC and the Civil Service in 2018, where they quickly managed to get themselves involved with D&I work. They work with PRISM within HMRC providing their support and expertise on a local and national level and are always happy to bring and share their experiences as a queer non-binary person. They also serve on the a:gender executive committee, where they have been an Ordinary Member, Secretary (their current role) and will soon be covering for the Chair while she takes some well-earned leave. In this role Cleo has shared personal stories and talked about exciting grammar facts (including pronouns!) to departments across the government. Not satisfied with all that Cleo also works as an equality rep for ARC and with the LGBT+ network within their department in HMRC (Solicitors Office and Legal Services) where, among other activities, they help organise and run a legendary film and book club.
