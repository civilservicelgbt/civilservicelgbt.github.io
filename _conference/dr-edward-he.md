Edward joined the Civil Service in January 2019. He finds it is a very inclusive and diverse place to work for. Edward has previously worked in R&D, Higher Education, the heavy industry, including the steelworks, oil & gas and aviation sectors.

Growing up in a traditional Chinese family, he has had first-hand experiences on some of the challenges and barriers facing LGBT+ individuals from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

Over the years, Edward has worked with various LGBT+ staff networks and organisations and has been a LGBT+ champion throughout his career. 

He currently serves as a Vice Chair for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, a STEM Ambassador, a Professional Registration Advisor for the IET, a University Career Mentor, as well as a Trustee for a cancer support charity in South Wales.

He wants to help create a culture within the Civil Service where we can truly be ourselves, value our similarities and appreciate our differences.
