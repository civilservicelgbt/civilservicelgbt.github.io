We will be using Slido throughout the event to allow you to participate in polls and submit questions to speakers. You can also use it to submit feedback throughout the event.

You can use Slido on any device you have with you, provided you have an active internet connection. GovWifi is available at the venue and we recommend you register for this service before you arrive.

The Slido will be moderated throughout the event. Please remember to follow our [standards of behaviour](/rules/standards-of-behaviour/) when participating in Slido.

You should use your real name when posting comments or questions.
