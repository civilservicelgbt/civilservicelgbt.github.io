We know that many LGBT+ people are nervous about security vetting and that this can often be a barrier to roles requiring higher levels of security clearance.

We know that many LGBT+ people are nervous about security vetting and that this can often be a barrier to roles requiring higher levels of security clearance. 

The session will cover the work that has been done to make vetting more inclusive and aims to provide a better understanding of what vetting involves. 

The session is open to both those considering applying for jobs that require vetting and those who already hold vetting. 

The session will be jointly facilitated by the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and UK Security Vetting.

There will be an opportunity ask questions.
