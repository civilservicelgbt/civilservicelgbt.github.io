The Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be hosting an in-person listening circle for LGBT+ delegates with an ethnic minority background during the conference. This will be an opportunity to share your experiences and opinions of how being an LGBT+ Ethnic minority have shaped your experience of being a civil servant. 

This will be an informal safe space to talk about career development and personal growth and will also be a chance for the network to learn what LGBT+ delegates with an ethnic minority background want from it. 

Listening circle facilitated by Marc Fitchett, Head of Finance, Homelessness & Rough Sleeping, Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and Civil Service LGBT+ Network Vice-Chair.
