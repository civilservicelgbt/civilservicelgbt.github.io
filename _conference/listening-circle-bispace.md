The BiSpace team will be providing a safe space for Bi, Pan, Queer, Ace/aro and other minority sexual orientations to network across government and build confidence through finding common ground.

Our recent virtual BiSpace events have identified that people have an appetite for informally networking with each other. We will also provide the opportunity to reflect on the importance of out Bi+/Ace+ role models at work and how they create an inclusive space where we can be our authentic selves and thus allow our performance to flourish.

Listening circle facilitated by Sunny Thompson, Internal Engagement Facilitator, Rural Payments Agency and Civil Service LGBT+ Network Vice chair for Bi+ inclusion.
