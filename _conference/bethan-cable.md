**She/Her (hi/ei yn Gymraeg)**

**Vice Chair, Pride in Crown Commercial Service; Wales organiser, Civil Service LGBT+ Network**

**SEO, Commercial** 

Bethan has worked for the Crown Commercial Service (an executive agency of the Cabinet Office) for nearly ten years, in a wide-ranging variety of roles but currently as Research and Digital Content Operations Manager for the Crown Commercial Service. More importantly (at least for this conference!), she is also the founder and current vice chair of our LGBTQ+ network, Pride in CCS, and a regional organiser for the Wales branch of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. She has worked in the field of I&D (in addition to the 'day job') for around four years, specialising in organising and running interesting events – whether that’s a lively in-person social in the best cocktail bar in Cardiff, or raising money for charity through an online Q&A with some real-life LGBTQ+ history icons!
