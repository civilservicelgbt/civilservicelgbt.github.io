**She/Her**

**Registration Officer, HM Land Registry**

**AO, Operational Delivery**

Working for HM Land Registry in an Operational Delivery role, Sarah Bee joined the Civil Service during lockdown having previously enjoyed a career in quality management and further education. She is on the steering group of HMLRs award winning LGBT+ staff network, The Pride Network, and a member of A:Gender, the independent national network supporting all trans and intersex staff across government. Highlights of her time with HMLR thus far include advising on LGBT+ policy reform and increasing inclusion through educational initiatives. She is no stranger to the stage, although maybe more used to it as a member of various rock bands rather than public speaking. She brings a wealth of experience from her own LGBT+ journey, from supporting others in both a workplace and an educational pastoral setting, and as a parent to her gender diverse daughter.
