Matt is based in Manchester and has been in the Civil Service since October 2017. He has been involved with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network since 2018 organising the Manchester socials and created the Northwest region. Now he is one of three Northwest local organisers, alongside Ross and Bryan, who deliver three socials a month (Blackpool/Preston, Liverpool and Manchester) and a monthly regional newsletter. They organise the Civil Service LGBT+ presence at Pride events and in 2022 covered 8 Prides across 4 counties and in total 30 events over the year. In his spare time Matt makes the rainbow awareness ribbons to promote diversity and inclusion which are worn by civil servants across the country. His favourite quote is from Lily Tomlin which is “I always wondered why somebody doesn’t do something about that. Then I realised I was somebody.”
