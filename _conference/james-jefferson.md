James joined the civil service in 2018 and has worked on a range of regeneration and levelling up policies. Currently he is the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning lead for Freeports within the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. This to date has involved setting up the evaluation plan for the policy and exploring ways in which we can learn from the data collected. He is also the government lead for the Plymouth and South Devon Freeport given his local connections to Devon. James has been a vice chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network since 2019 and led on a number of projects including the collaborative team effort behind the PrideON initiative during the summer of 2020. He took up the role of organising the conference last year.
