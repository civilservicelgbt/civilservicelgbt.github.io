title: Consolidating your learning
event: conference-2022
section: after
---
* After each session, we recommend you make a note of three things you have learnt or can take away to support you with your own personal career development. This can either be mental note, on a notepad, on a mobile phone. Doing so means you can revisit these notes once back in the workplace, to see what action you could take and if you would benefit from setting any new development goals.
* You may wish to share your learning with colleagues in your department. You can most likely do this via an email or within a team meeting. Speak to your line manager or learning and development team in the first instance on how best to share your learning back. 
* You may also wish to capture other colleagues work contact details where they have a particular skill or area of expertise that could support you in your development. Please be mindful that not everyone will be able to or will want to share contact details. 
* Any resources used on the day will be uploaded to our website or distributed to conference attendees in due course.
