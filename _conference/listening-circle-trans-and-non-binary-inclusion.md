The Trans and Non-Binary Inclusion team will provide a safe space for trans, non-binary and genderqueer people to network across government. 

We will also provide an opportunity to reflect on the importance of trans and non-binary role models and allies at work and how they create an inclusive environment where we can be our authentic selves and allow people to flourish.

Lï»¿ed by Alan Edwards, Civil Service LGBT+ Network Vice chair for Trans and non-binary inclusion.
