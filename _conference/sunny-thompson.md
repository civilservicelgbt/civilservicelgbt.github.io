Sunny Thompson is a Vice Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network leading on Bisexual "plus" issues, providing community for bi, pan, queer, ace and other civil servants who do not neatly fit into straight or gay categories.Â  Sunny stepped up to lead the BiSpace volunteer team last year after several years of being a volunteer. BiSpace runs regular virtual events providing opportunities for members of the community to network, socialise and gain support and education. Sunny has been involved in LGBT+ advocacy since being at Sheffield University in the late 90s. Sunny joined the Civil Service in 2003 and lives in Cumbria with a husband, daughter and two cats.
