The Civil Service Network will be hosting an in-person listening circle for LGBT+ women during the conference. This will be an opportunity to share your experiences and opinions of how being an LGBT+ women have shaped your experience of being a civil servant. 

This will be an informal safe space to talk about career development and personal growth and will also be a chance for the network to learn what LGBT+ women want from it. 

The network is passionate about ensuring inclusivity, and we realise that LGBT+ women are often underrepresented at its events.
