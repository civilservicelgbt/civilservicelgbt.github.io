2023 marks 20 years since the formation of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network (formerly the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance) and a:gender; the two cross-government networks representing civil servants with minority sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and variations in sex characteristics.

Join us as we mark our 20th 'birthday', looking back on the progress the Civil Service has made as an inclusive employer and explore what's next for LGBT+ inclusion in central government.
