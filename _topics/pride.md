  Everything you need to know about Civil Service Pride 2024. 


  We are hopeful that we will be able to support attendance at pride events in 2024 this year, we are hoping that we will be able to support some of the most popular larger prides as well as a strong selection of free grassroots prides. 


  More details will be published on the events by the middle of April 2024. At this point registration to parade with us will also open.
