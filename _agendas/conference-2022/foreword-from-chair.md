The Civil Service LGBT+ Network exists to connect LGBT+ civil servants across government, to make sure they feel safe at work, and to help them develop in their careers. The Civil Service LGBT+ Conference 2022 is one way we are delivering on that mission, and meeting one of the commitments I made to you when I was elected as Chair in last year.

This is the first conference that the cross-government network has hosted since 2017. I'm thrilled that we are able to welcome 250 LGBT+ staff from across the UK to the event. For those that are unable to join in person we will be offering an online-only version of the conference's content later this year.

[The latest Civil Service Diveristy and Inclusion Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-strategy-2022-to-2025/civil-service-diversity-and-inclusion-strategy-2022-to-2025-html) sets out a vision where diversity and inclusion is not an end in itself, but an integral means of delivering better public services. By valuing the diversity of our teams, investing in our people, tackling bullying and harassment and being evidence-led in our policies. The sessions at this year's conference have been designed to act as part of our contribution, as a network, to delivering on that vision.

All our work as a network is volunteer-led, and we couldn't put on events like this without their help. I want to thank the volunteers who have made today's conference possible â€“ particularly our Vice Chair, James Jefferson who has led the team.

I hope you will enjoy your time at the conference, and will take full advantage of this valuable learning opportunity.
