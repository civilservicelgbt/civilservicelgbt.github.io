## About this publication

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network helps to create a more diverse, inclusive and equal place to work for civil servants with minority sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and variations in sex characteristics.

We are an employee network created to ensure LGBT+ staff can be themselves, be their best selves and help to deliver great public services. We do that by:

- building local and national communities of LGBT+ civil servants
- supporting the development of strong LGBT+ employee networks in Civil Service bodies
- representing the interests of LGBT+ staff across the Civil Service

This document explains our priorities and our programmes of work. It also records our progress in delivering against those priorities.

## How this will be delivered

The work detailed in this plan will be delivered by a [volunteer team](/team) of LGBT+ people and allies from across the Civil Service.

> If you'd like to volunteer to help deliver this plan, or have another idea you'd like to lead, please contact us at: <info@civilservice.lgbt>

All of our work is delivered on a volunteer-led basis. If you feel there's something missing from this plan, we'd love to have you join the team to deliver it.
