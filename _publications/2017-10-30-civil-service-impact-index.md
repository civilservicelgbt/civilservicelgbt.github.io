## Publication description

**We are proud to introduce the first ever Civil Service LGBT+ Impact Index.**

The Civil Service LGBT+ Impact Index celebrates the civil servants making things better for LGBT+ people.

The Impact Index is a new initiative from the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance - the network representing LGBT+ civil servants - to recognise the important work that LGBT+ civil servants and allies do to improve the Civil Service and the public services that LGBT+ people rely on.

It builds on our work in recent years, highlighting the positive LGBT+ role models working in government.

The individuals, networks and teams featured in this Index are making things better for LGBT+ people: and we're proud to recognise them for their commitment to advancing LGBT equality both in the Civil Service and elsewhere.

You can see all the winners on our [Impact Index website](/impact-index), or you can [download a copy to print](/impact-index/assets/booklet-print.pdf). We have a limited number of hard copies of the guide too; if you'd like one, [email us](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).
