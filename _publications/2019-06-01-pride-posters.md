## Publication description

50 years ago this month, a riot at a bar in New York — the Stonewall Inn — sparked a LGBT rights movement, and kickstarted annual pride protests around the world. This year, we're once again taking part in pride events across the UK — and celebrating this important milestone.

For Pride this year, we're reminding everyone why the Civil Service is an inclusive place to work. Use these posters to highlight your pride in the Civil Service, and to highlight 50 years of Pride.
