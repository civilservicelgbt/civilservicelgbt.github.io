### General campaign conduct 

Candidates may advertise their candidacy through any appropriate means, ensuring they operate within the Civil Service Code and usual departmental conduct policies at all times.

If a candidate is an existing volunteer for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, with access to mailing lists or other network resources, they may not use these to assist their campaign.

## Voting

In line with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's constitution, voting in this election will be based on an electoral college system, with each network's vote having equal weighting.

Individual staff may be eligible to vote via their departmental or agency LGBT+ networks. You should contact your departmental network to ask them how they will be organising their internal vote.

### Eligibility to vote 

A department is eligible to vote in the election if:

1. it is a UK Civil Service employer and [listed on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations) – devolved administrations, crown bodies, or other entities are not eligible to vote in this election.
2. it has an active LGBT+ network
3. we hold a recently confirmed email address for either a shared mailbox or the network chair

> We have published [a list of government departments that are eligible to vote](/election/2023/networks). If you are a departmental network chair, check that your network is on the list before the deadline. 
> 
> If your network is not listed on the list of eligible networks, please contact <election@civilservice.lgbt> before 16 May 2023 at 09:00.

### Re-open nominations

'Re-open nominations' (or 'R.O.N') will be a candidate in this election. Networks must include 'Re-open nominations' as an option in their internal ballot. 

If 'R.O.N' is the first placed candidate in the election, receiving more than 50% of the vote, the election will be suspended and nominations will be re-opened over the summer.
  
### Voting process

This election will take place under a first-past-the-post system: the candidate who receives the largest number votes will be elected. 

Each network may cast 1 vote and may vote for one candidate only.

A department's vote is valid if:

1. the departmental LGBT+ network has conducted an internal vote of its membership or its committee to determine which candidate it is supporting
2. the outcome of the vote, and other required information, is submitted from the network's shared mailbox or chair's email address before the voting deadline

> We have produced guidance on [how to conduct an internal vote](/election/2023/guidance-internal-vote) in a separate guidance document.

> Networks can find out [how to submit their vote]() in our separate guidance document.

## Raising a concern

If you wish to raise a concern about the conduct of the election, you can contact the returning officer by emailing <election@civilservice.lgbt>.
