## Introduction

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network helps to create a more diverse, inclusive and equal place to work for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT+) civil servants. We represent the interests of an estimated 20,000 LGBT+ people working in the UK Civil Service.

**This is our business plan for 2018 to 2020.** It explains the most significant work we will do over the next two years.

**We will publish an update to this plan every six months.** It will explain the progress we have made against objectives and targets in this plan.

Our work helps us deliver against our four priorities:

  **building strong and stable networks:** providing support and assurance for local networks, so that every civil servant can access a locally based LGBT+ network
- **creating a diverse and inclusive community:** doing more to actively engage under-represented groups within the LGBT+ community, such as bisexual staff and women, and working on issues faced by people with multiple protected characteristics
- **having a national impact:** ensuring that our activities are nationally inclusive and regionally based, and that people feel connected to a community regardless of where they live
- **understanding and representing your needs:** ensuring that all our work is evidence based and that we accurately represent the views of our members to stakeholders, challenging discrimination, and promoting awareness of LGBT+ issues

## Our plan

### Strong and stable networks

To support the development of **strong and stable networks**, over the next two years we will:

1. **establish a Heads of Networks Forum** to guide our work and share best practice
2. **develop and share best practice policies and guidance that can be used across departments** so that networks can use these to internally influence their stakeholders to improve departmental policies and processes
3. **support departments with the completion of the Stonewall Workplace Equality Index** by producing guidance on building inclusive departments and a toolkit to support submissions

### Diverse and inclusive community

To **create a diverse and inclusive community**, in the next two years we will:

1. **take part in at least 3 Pride events each year** and monitor the diversity of those taking part
2. **create a new community space for bisexual civil servants** and implement [the recommendations from our bisexuality consultation](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/publication/improving-the-experiences-of-bisexual-civil-servants/) last year
3. **establish a new LGBT+ and faith project** to understand the needs and experiences of LGBT+ people who are also part of a religious community
4. **establish a national LGBT+ allies programme** to help networks engage allies in their departments
5. **establish joint projects with other cross-government networks** to explicitly highlight intersectionality of these groups
6. **run regular campaigns highlighting less visible communities within the LGBT+ population** such as LGBT+ women, transgender people, and LGBT+ people who are black or have a minority ethnicity

### National reach

To ensure that we have a **national reach** that supports civil servants wherever they live, we will:

1. **pilot an online space for LGBT+ civil servants to network** helping LGBT+ staff to connect with others in their local area, even when they can't physically meet
2. **support local organisers** by creating re-usable toolkits to help anyone set up events or activities in their local area
3. **pilot a national LGBT+ mentoring scheme** for LGBT+ civil servants looking for a mentor
4. **establish more networking and social events outside London**

### Understanding and representing your needs

To ensure we **understand and represent your needs**, we are going to:

1. **advocate for standardised sexual orientation and gender identity monitoring in Civil Service systems and processes** so that we better understand the needs and experiences of LGBT+ civil servants compared with other civil servants
2. **ensure networks have access to the main findings of the Civil Service People Survey results for LGBT+ staff** and how their own departments compare with others across government

## Help us deliver this plan

**We need volunteers to help us deliver this plan.** You can use your volunteer days or support our network using as your “corporate contribution”. All our current [volunteering opportunities are listed on this website](/2018/06/01/were-looking-for-volunteers).
