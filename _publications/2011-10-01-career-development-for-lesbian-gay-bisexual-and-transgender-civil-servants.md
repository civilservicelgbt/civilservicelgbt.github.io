## About this document

In 2011 the Civil Service Rainbow Alliance (now the Civil Service LGBT+ Network) published a report into the experiences of LGB&T civil servants in the workplace. 

The document drew on research carried out independently over 2010 and 2011, as well as using Civil Service People Survey data and industry benchmarking information in order to get a picture of the culture of the Civil Service and the barriers to career development that LGB&T civil servants experienced. 

The 100 page report is the first document we know of that specifically looked at the experiences of LGB&T civil servants separately from non-LGB&T civil servants.
