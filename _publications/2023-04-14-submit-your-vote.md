## About this document

An election for the chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network has been called, following the [resignation of the incumbent chair](/news/2023/04/14/chair-stepping-down-john-peart/). 

This document is intended for election organisers in departments. It explains how to submit your vote to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, on behalf of your departmental or agency LGBT+ network.

## Pre-requisites

Before you submit your vote, you should ensure that you are [eligible to vote](/election/2023/rules#voting) and that your departmental network is [listed on the networks list](/election/2023/networks). 

You should also ensure that you have [conducted an internal vote of your membership or your committee](/election/2023/guidance-internal-vote).

If you do not meet these criteria, or your network is not listed, your vote will not count.

## Submitting your vote

The results of your internal vote must be submitted by email before the deadline. 

The email must be sent from the same email address listed on [the list of organisations that are eligible to vote](/election/2023/networks).

Your email should contain the following information:

- the name of your department or agency
- the method by which you conducted your vote (full membership vote or committee vote)
- the total number of votes cast in your internal vote
- the candidate that received the highest number of votes
- a list of each candidate, and the number of votes received for each candidate
