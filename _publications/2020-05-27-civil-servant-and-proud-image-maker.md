## Publication description

We are keeping PrideON for the Civil Service, to make sure our voices are heard and, we continue to be visible.

We have created a package of digital assets for you to use and share around your teams to promote LGBT+ visibility. Be sure to post these on social media, add one to your email signature, change your video call background and encourage your colleagues to do it too.
