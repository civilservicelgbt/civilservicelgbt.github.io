## Image Maker

We are keeping PrideON for the Civil Service, to make sure our voices are heard and we continue to be visible.

We have created a tool for you to market your events under our PrideON branding across your social media pages and departments.

You are able to use this tool to create images for social media with your own text. The tool produces images in the correct sizes for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Be sure to use this tool to create assets to advertise your own events and content. Please tag [@cslgbt](https://twitter.com/cslgbt) on Twitter, [@civilservicelgbt](https://instagram.com/civilservicelgbt) on Instagram and 'Civil Service LGBT+ Network' on Facebook so we can repost.

> [Use our image maker to make your own](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/image-maker/pride-on), to use the image maker.

## Departmental communications

To ensure PrideON reaches as many Civil Servants as possible, please encourage your colleagues to share our events, content and resources.

We have created an example blog post that you can ask your communications or digital team to publish on your departments intranet.

We have also created an example email you can send to your colleagues and senior civil servants in your department, explaining what PrideON is and how they can help.

## Social Media

Be sure to tag us on social media and use the hashtag #PrideON and #CivilServicePride. We will share your content throughout the month.
