We recently updated our [privacy and data statement](/privacy-and-data/). These changes have been made because we have changed the services we use to send our email alerts.

We now use GOV.UK Notify to send our bulk emails instead of MailChimp.

Data that was stored in MailChimp will be transferred to a new location such that we can continue to deliver email alerts to existing members. Once this process has been completed, all data on MailChimp will be deleted permanently.

These changes will take effect no later than 1 December 2021.
