We recently updated our [privacy and data statement](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/about/your-data/). These changes were made because we have adopted a new service for our bulk email delivery system.

We used to use Mailchimp for all our emails. As our network has grown and we've started new programmes like the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme, Mailchimp's services are no longer suitable for all of our needs.

The privacy and data statement has been updated to reflect that we now use GOV.UK Notify to deliver bulk emails, as well as Mailchimp.

No further changes have been made to the statement in this update.
