We recently updated our [privacy and data statement](/privacy-and-data/). These changes were made because we plan to provide some new digital services to our members in the near future.

Changes to the policy include:

- information about a new forum service, and how we will collect and use data as part of providing this service
- information about changes to our service providers
- information about how we take steps to keep information secure, how long we aim to retain data for, and how we manage links to third parties
- information about how to request your account on a new forum service be deleted
