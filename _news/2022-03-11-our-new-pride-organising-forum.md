The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating this yearâ€™s, nationwide Pride participation for the Civil Service, alongside an online programme of events this summer.

We know LGBT+ civil servants and allies always have lots of questions and ideas about what we do for Pride, so we're creating a new regular chance to get involved.

The Pride Organising Forum is an opportunity for any civil servant who is involved in organising activities for Pride in their department or agency to hear about our plans and help to shape them.

The forum will particularly focus on attendance at physical pride marches and parades across the country, but also on our online programme for 2022. 

The meetings will take place every 4 weeks, starting on 14 March 2022. You can [register to attend via the events page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/).
