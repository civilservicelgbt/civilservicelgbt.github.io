I am delighted to be stepping into the role of Vice Chair for Bi+ Inclusion and to lead our BiSpace programme, and grateful for the opportunity to lead a fantastic team. I have been a member of the BiSpace team for several years, and am looking forward to working closely with them, with John our Network Chair, and with the other Vice Chairs to deliver the Network’s priorities.

## A forward plan for BiSpace

I recently met with the BiSpace Team and we agreed our priorities for the coming year, with a focus on:

- education, history and culture
- socials and networking
- combatting bullying, harassment and discrimination

## BiSpace meet-ups

We would like to return to in-person socials, but as ever we will have to keep a close eye on the ever evolving picture with regards to Covid and be mindful of current government guidance. The situation is changing rapidly.

I’m very grateful that I had the chance to meet a couple of others from the network “in real life” for a small but perfectly formed social in London earlier this week just before the work from home guidance resumed. We reflected on how lovely it is just to get the chance to be in the company of other bi+ people.

Regardless of Covid developments we will continue to offer online opportunities for connection, as these can be inclusive for all sorts of reasons. As someone based in the far north I know I appreciate them, as it’s not always easy for me to get to major cities like London. Of course if there are local volunteers willing to lead socials in other cities that is certainly something we would be willing to embrace when the situation improves again, safety and current guidance permitting.

## Get involved with BiSpace

Speaking of volunteers, a few of our team have had to move on recently so we are keen to recruit more. If you are interested in helping us to make the Civil Service a more welcoming and inclusive place for bi+ colleagues please do get in touch at <sunny.thompson@civilservice.lgbt>.

We would love to hear your ideas and have more people to help us run projects.
