Are you looking for an exciting opportunity to help the Civil Service LGBT+ Network? Do you want to help organise local events, socials, sports, activities, trips with likeminded Civil Servants?

A﻿s we enter into a new year the Civil Service LGBT+ Network has had a stocktake of its regional organisers to make sure we can deliver the best for our members moving into 2024.

O﻿ur local organisers do a great job at connecting like minded Civil Servants across the whole of the UK. Some of our local organisers step back from time to time to focus on other work and opportunities. For those stepping away from the role, thank you for all of your help and support during your time in the role.

A﻿ local organiser is an important part of our community, they organise socials, pride entries, act as a point of contact for the Network and more. Are you someone that is energised to make a difference in the community in your local region and beyond, do you want to bring people together to build a sense of community and belonging, then being a local organiser may be for you. During 2023 we held, co-hosted, supported and advertised well over 100 different items and this year I am sure we will continue to grow. 

W﻿e are looking for additional support with our Local Organising in some specific regions, if your region is not listed though and you would like to get involved please do get in touch. 

S﻿pecific locations include; North East, Blackpool/Preston, Scotland, South East, South West and Wales.

Certain regions also have channels of informal communications, Local Organisers have the ability to reach out to members and advertise events/items directly to them. Some regions don’t have this yet, but you might like to set this up and run with monthly comms. For more information on Google Groups, check out the [Groups Page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/groups/).

If you would like to be part of a great team of volunteers that make this network happen please do get in touch with [vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt) highlighting what region you are in, how you think you could help the network and then the VC for Regions and Nations will be in touch to have a conversation around the role.
