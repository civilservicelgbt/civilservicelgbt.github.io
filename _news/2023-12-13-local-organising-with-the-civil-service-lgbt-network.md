Are you looking for an exciting opportunity to help the Civil Service LGBT+ Network?

Do you want to help organise local events, socials, sports, activities, trips with likeminded Civil Servants?

We are looking for additional Local Organisers in some of our regions, it would be great to find more coverage for the North East, South Easy

Local Organisers play a vital role in building and maintaining our members on the group. There involvement in coordinating events and supporting the delivery of CS LGBT+ Network Pride presence is great. During 2023 we held, co-hosted, supported and advertised well over 100 different items and next year I am sure we will continue to grow. 

Certain regions also have channels of informal communications, Local Organisers have the ability to reach out to members and advertise stuff directly to them. Some regions donâ€™t have this yet, but you might like to set this up and run with monthly comms. For more information on Google Groups, check out the [Groups Page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/groups/).

If you would like to be part of a great team of volunteers that make this network happen please do get in touch with [vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt) highlighting what region you are in, how you think you could help the network and then the VC for Regions and Nations will be in touch to have a conversation around the role.
