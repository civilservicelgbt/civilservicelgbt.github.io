The Civil Service LGBT+ Network has run social and networking events across the UK for more than a decade. Since lockdown restrictions eased last year, we've rebooted them in our usual locations. Now we're adding even more!

## All the locations

For the first time, you'll now be able to attend socials in all of these locations:

- Birmingham
- Bristol
- Edinburgh
- Glasgow
- Liverpool
- London
- Manchester
- Southampton

All of these socials are led by our 'local organiser' team.

## Join us at the events

If you'd like to attend one of our events: register your information so we can update you of any changes, and then just turn up! 

Details of where the events are taking place are always published on our website at [www.civilservice.lgbt/events](/events). 

Remember to check the specific page a few days before hand for information about the specific venue.

## Join the team

If organising this kind of thing is up your alley, why not join the local organiser team? If you'd like to get involved, please contact our Vice-Chair, [Ed](/team/ed).
