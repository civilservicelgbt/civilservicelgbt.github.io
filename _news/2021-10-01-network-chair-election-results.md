I’m pleased to announce that [John Peart](https://twitter.com/johnpeart) is elected into the role of Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

John has a wealth of experience in LGBT+ issues and has been a volunteer for the network in various capacities since 2013. If you would like to know more about him [visit his election statement](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/news/2021/09/09/john-peart-election-statement).
John will officially take over from me today but I will still be around for the next couple of weeks as we do an in-flight handover. 


## My final thought

It has been a privilege and a pleasure to lead this network, thank you all for your input and support. I’ll leave you with one final request which echoes the post I wrote a few weeks ago announcing that I was standing down.

This network exists for all of us, but it can’t survive on the efforts of a handful of people. There is an incredible amount of work going on in the background to make things happen and for that to continue we need members to volunteer their time and skills. Tell John what you want and need from your network, but then go one small step further and help him to make that happen.
