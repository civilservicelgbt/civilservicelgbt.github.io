This yearâ€™s pride applications are now live. The one form can be used to apply to join us at all of the pride parades, all pride events are listed on the '[Pride 2023](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/topic/pride)' page. Find the form in any of the pride events on our website. 

Some of the parades will be balloted. At the moment we think that this will be Pride Cymru, Pride in London and Manchester Pride. However, depending on uptake of other parades others may also go to a ballot, if this is the case a note will be added to that events page. 

Full details will be added to all pride event pages in due course. If you have any questions, please do get in touch with your '[Local Organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/)'. If you or your local Civil Service Department Networks are organising something for pride and would like it advertised wider, then please do get in touch with [vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt).
