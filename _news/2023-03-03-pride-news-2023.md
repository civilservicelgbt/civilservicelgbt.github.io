The Civil Service will once again be attending a number of pride parades in the UK. The focus this year is going to be on the capital cities across the UK and Manchester as this was the largest Civil Service pride event outside of London in 2022.

For information on the main prides all information will be included on the ‘[Pride 2023](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/topic/pride)’ page.

As well as these events, our local organisers will be busy over the pride season setting up both parades and socials at many other locations. Details of where these will be will be included on the ‘[Events](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/)’ page. Regular socials, events organised by the local organisers and some events by departmental networks are also shared on the same '[Events](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/)' page.

If you have any questions about pride events in your area you can always get in touch with your ‘[Local Organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/)’. Some Regions and Nations have a email Groups, for more information on these and how to join, visit our '[Groups](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/groups/)' page.
