Hi all! As the new Vice Chairs for Ethnic Minority Inclusion, we would like to say hello to everyone! 



Together we are hoping to create a safe environment for Civil Service staff who are both LGBT+ and who have a minority ethnicity to meet others, like themselves, and to provide opportunities to network. 



We are hoping to run monthly, bi-monthly, and annual events to increase engagement with LGBT+ network and to enhance cohesion of staff who have a minority ethnicity within the Civil Service. This will include:



- virtual and in-person socials
- panel events aimed at career development
- and joint events with other Civil Service networks



We are also aiming to run research projects to better understand any barriers experienced by LGBT+ and ethnic minority colleagues at work and how to address those challenges. 



One of our aims is to promote and generate engagement with the network through increasing visibility and sharing events and opportunities across the Civil Service. If anyone would like to volunteer to support with any (or all!) of these proposed initiatives, please do reach out to us for more information.
