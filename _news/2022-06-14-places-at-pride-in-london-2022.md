Pride in London 2022 is only a few weeks away. 

As we explained when we announced our plans for pride 2022, there are only a limited number of places we are able to offer for Pride in London each year. We committed to running a ballot to allocate places in our parade group, around 4 weeks prior to the event.

We have now concluded the ballot and places have been allocated. 

## If you have been allocated a place

If you have been allocated a place, you will have received an email from us confirming you're in our parade group. Further details will be released shortly.

Your place is for you and you alone. We cannot offer places for additional friends or family, due to limited capacity.

## We're running a reserve list

If you didn't get a place, you will be automatically placed on a reserve list. The reserve list will be drawn from on a first-come-first-served basis, to make sure we fill all our places.

You will be emailed when a place becomes available.

## Cancelling a place

If you no longer wish to attend, please email us at <pride@civilservice.lgbt>.
