Pride season is quickly drawing to a close, as a Network there is only one more and by the time you read this it may have been. Middlesbrough Pride ends our Civil Service LGBT+ Network run of events, and what a season it has been.

There will be something more substantial published in the coming months when there is a full post pride review completed. Please keep an eye out for the Pride 2024 feedback form that will be being send out to all members that signed up to any prides, regardless of whether you attended or not. Please take the few minutes to complete this, it is really helpful in shaping 2025.

Before we move on, I want to thank all the Local Organisers who make pride season such a success, collating information, organising meeting points, parade entries, t-shirt collections, acting as responsible persons in the parade and much more. These events would not be a success without them. Thank You!

It is not just pride season and prides that the Network is heavily involved in. There are loads of social events that are happening around the UK all year round. These events vary from; lunch time café socials, picnics in the park, volunteering days, cinema clubs, book clubs and bar-based socials.

As a volunteer Network the Local Organisers to a great job at facilitating and supporting the Network in delivering these events, if there is something that doesn’t happen in your region and you would like to get involved, please do make suggestions and or offer to help run an event, our Local Organisers will do everything they can to support you.

Some regions have socials starting up again after some time off, Southampton has its first run of socials coming up from October! Some regions would also love some more dedicated support, if you are in the SW, Wales or East Anglia and want to get involved as a Local Organiser please do get in touch.

For all the events please check out the events tab at the top of the page. For more information on what being a Local Organiser entails please get in touch at [vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:vice-chair-regions@civilservice.lgbt)
