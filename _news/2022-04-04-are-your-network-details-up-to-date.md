The **Civil Service LGBT+ Network** maintains a list of [departmental and agency LGBT+ networks across government](/networks), as well as an internal list of network chairs and volunteers.

These lists get out of date pretty quickly, and that means we can't easily communicate cross-government messages and you might miss out!

If you're a chair or committee member of your LGBT+ network, please check our [Networks page](/networks) to see if your contact email address is correct. If it isn't correct, please email us at <info@civilservice.lgbt> to let us know.

If you're not a network chair, but you know your network's details and they're not on our list â€“ that's helpful too! Send us an email to let us know.
