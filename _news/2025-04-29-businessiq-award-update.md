The Northern Echo’s third BUSINESSiQ magazine awards were held on April 11th and exceeded everyone’s expectations with a glittering ceremony at Wynyard Hall where more than 250 of the region’s most influential business people celebrated innovation, resilience, and community spirit throughout the North East.

Unfortunately, our representative, Sebastian Moore, Business Relationship Manager at HM Treasury and DEC Pride Network chair was unsuccessful in the Diversity & Inclusion Award. Special guests were a bit thin on the ground this year apart from John McCabe DL the chief executive of Northern Chamber of Commerce who you can see in the picture on the left with Seb in the centre.

Seb was narrowly beaten by the North East Autism Society who are a huge organisation and run 60 sites from Northumberland to Teesside, including four schools, a college, a vocational training farm, employment services, short breaks lodges, residential and supported living homes, adult day services, and family support.

To give a further flavour of the high level of competition other award winners included Middlesbrough College who took home the Employee Health and Wellbeing Award. South West Durham Training secured the Training and Skills Award, the Community Impact Award, went to Dogger Bank Wind Farm, and in the creative sphere, renowned artist Lucy Pittaway who has many galleries in our region was named Creative Business of the Year.

Against such competition it was a significant achievement for Seb just to make the shortlist, so well done to him for getting that far.  Our loss is Autism’s gain, and we wish him good luck at future awards.
