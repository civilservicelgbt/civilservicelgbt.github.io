Hi everyone and welcome to the second instalment of a Chairs Eye View. We’ll be highlighting the month ahead, sharing news, views and upcoming events.

Sunday is World AIDS Day which is observed annually on the 1st of December globally. It’s dedicated to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS, showing support for those living with HIV or AIDS, and remembering those who we’ve sadly lost from AIDS related illnesses, not just in the LGBT+ community, but beyond too.

In Northern Ireland, the Rainbow Project in Belfast have organised for the AIDS memorial quilt to visit Belfast. As a network we regularly organise informal networking and social events that colleagues across the Civil Service can join, to learn and meet new colleagues with similar interests.

Throughout December there will be a variety of events as we lead up to the festive period and New Year.

[The CS LGBT+ Network, DTS and CGI are hosting a volunteering day in Salford (Monday 2nd December)](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-11-13-cs-lgbt-network-social-salford-tree-planting-volunteer-day/), where they’ll be planting trees in a local cemetery. This follows on from another volunteering day where network members volunteered to help clear up Sackville Gardens in Manchester’s Gay Village and litter picked on Formby beach.

There is still time to sign up to the above event. As the event in Belfast is ticketed, it is likely not possible to sign up at this stage, but we look forward to hearing about the experience from colleagues.

Our Local Organiser Network led by Ross has been as busy as ever organising a plethora of events for colleagues throughout the festive period. I’ve highlighted most locations below but keep an eye on the [events page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/) of our website for any others that may pop up.

Leeds, Glasgow, Sheffield, Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Bristol, Manchester, Southampton, Cardiff.

The [London Film Club](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-09-09-london-film-club-2/) will be meeting in person again at the Prince Charles Cinema for a viewing of The Muppet Christmas Carol, with pre and post socials. There is still time to sign up for this event on Tuesday 3rd December.

As well as the in-person socials there are several virtual events throughout December. The Planning Inspectorate’s Rainbow Network has organised a virtual event with representatives from the London Gay Men’s Chorus - Europe’s largest gay choir. Come along to hear their story, learn about their performances, charity and outreach work. We may even hear some music…\

[Please contact Jeanie or Sarah if you’re interested in joining this event on Thursday 5th of December.](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-11-08-london-gay-mens-chorus-x-planning-inspectorate-rainbow-network/)

Saorsa and I will be hosting an informal Coffee & Chat with a festive twist on the Tuesday 17th of December 2024 12:30-13:30. If you’d like to join us for this event you can [sign up here](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/566845b2-b88b-4c7c-91d0-38dc01eec498@96f1f6e9-1057-4117-ac28-80cdfe86f8c3). Please sign up using your work email.

As we move into 2025, we’ve commissioned several working groups to explore the possibility of a Civil Service LGBT+ Conference, and how we can further diversify our network and ensure it’s a welcoming space for all LGBT+ Civil Servants and Allies, we’ll update you all on progress in the New Year.

If you’re interested in supporting the network in some way, please reach out to Saorsa and I via [chairs@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:chairs@civilservice.lgbt) or Ross if you’re interested in supporting the Local Organisers network.

Saorsa and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our amazing Local Organisers, and Vice-Chairs for their continued dedication and hard work throughout the year. For those members we may not see over the next few weeks, we wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

This time of year can also be stressful for many. Please reach out to us, your departmental network or wellbeing resources should you be feeling it this festive period. If you don’t know what they are then please speak to a representative from form your network or CS LGBT+.

All the best
