With 3 days to go we have had a number of spots that have opened up for Manchester Pride 2022. If you would like to join the North West Civil Service LGBT+ walking entry please email <northwest@civilservice.lgbt> with your T-Shirt size (S,M,L and XXL are the sizes available) as soon as possible.

We have increased our numbers and will have the biggest ever Civil Service presence at Manchester Pride ever.

## What happens next

Matt or Ross will confirm your email and send you the information pack through.

The Manchester Pride parade is on Saturday 27 August 2022.

Manchester has some areas over pride weekend that are ticketed. You will need a ticket if you wish to go in these areas. Tickets are sold directly via the Manchester Pride website.

## What happens if you now cannot make the parade?

If you cannot make the parade please email <northwest@civilservice.lgbt> as soon as possible so that the north west organisers can manage the reserve list for the parade.

> We're also taking part in Pride Cymru in Cardiff this weekend. If you'd like to join us, details are available on the [event page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2022-08-27-civil-service-at-pride-cymru/).
