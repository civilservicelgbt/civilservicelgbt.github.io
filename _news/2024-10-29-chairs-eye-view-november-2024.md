Hi everyone and welcome to the first of a regular monthly blog series where we will be looking forward to the month ahead, sharing some news and views, and highlighting upcoming events/dates.

On November 11th Planning Inspectorate are hosting  a teams event to which all civil servant are invited:

* **[PIINS Conversation with Hunter](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-10-25-piins-conversation-with-hunter/ "Read PIINS Conversation with Hunter")**

On 11 November 2024 at 11:00

The event includes a Q&A as a small independent queer bookshop discusses what it is like existing in a smaller town, serving our community, and providing a positive LGBT+ space.

In addition to this there are notable calendar dates for the LGBT+ community in November for which many departmental networks will be putting on their own events.

13th-19th November is Trans Awareness Week, a positive look at the reality of trans life and raising awareness and understanding of the issues the community faces. This ends with November 20th which is Trans Day of Remembrance (TDoR) when we remember those Trans and non-binary individuals lost to violence in the previous 12 months. Year on year well over 95% of reported murders at TDoR are of Trans women, and of these the overwhelming majority are Trans women of colour.

The 13th is world kindness day, the 16th is the International Day of Tolerance, and the 18th marks the start of anti-bullying week. With reported hate incidents against the LGBT+ community ever on the rise, and increasing sharply in recent years, civil service initiatives to tackle workplace bullying and harassment are vitally important. We, as a community, should engage with them not just to report cases of homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia, but to support all colleagues who may be subject to bullying and harassment for whatever reason. 

The 25th marks international day against violence against women. On behalf of our network, I’d like to extend support and solidarity from our Trans women, non-binary feminine, bisexual, and lesbian members to our cisgender and heterosexual sisters in our common struggle to end violence against all women and girls.

Finally, some news about some changes to the Network and new groups you may want to promote or get involved with. Ellie has been appointed our new vice-chair for Allies. This new group will seek to involve our community allies and assist, though ally training, an understanding of what it means to be a proactive ally, not just to the LGBT+ community but to any group. As I am fond of saying, “Allyship is a verb not a noun” so I look forward to seeing this group step into action.

Likewise, Lynda, Tracey, Stephen and Elsa have become vice-chairs and are to expand their already successful Parent’s, Carer’s and Partners group across the Civil Service to give a voice to this important group of community support, and so that we can support PC&Ps in return.

Jefferson and I have spent our first year fulfilling our initial commitments to the network. Now we look forward to taking it forward with your support in a new and vibrant direction.

Moving forward together: always together.
