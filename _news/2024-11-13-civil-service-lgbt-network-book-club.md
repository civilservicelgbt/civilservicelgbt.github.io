Starting a virtual LGBT+ book club was my New Year’s resolution for this year as I wanted to spend less time on social media, and it's been a brilliant success. I wanted to reconnect with books and people more, so instead of endless scrolling especially on TikTok, I decided to start something that would encourage both learning and genuine conversation.

I was initially worried if anyone would sign up or how to keep everyone engaged. But it turns out, there were plenty of people who also wanted to escape the online “highlight reels” and dive into the deeper connections and breakaway from screens.

To choose our first book I decided to send out 5 choices and allow people to vote. The club isn’t just about books—it’s been a space for shared laughter, advice, and discussions that go way beyond the plot I’ve had some great theatre and DVD recommendations already from this network. The group has quickly become a highlight of every month, and each month, it feels more like meeting up with friends I even allow myself a glass of wine sometimes when joining the evening discussion group.

I’ve been amazed at how much better my attention span has been and found audiobooks a great way to relax and cut off from toxic media. Cutting down on social media was hard at first, but reading again has become such a positive habit that I find I hardly miss the constant scroll and likes. The book club in less than 12 months has over 150 members and continues to strive.
