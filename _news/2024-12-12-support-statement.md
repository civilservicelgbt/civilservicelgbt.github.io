T﻿he CS LGBT+ Network notes the news yesterday that the Minister for Health intends to make permanent, pending further research, the ban on the use of puberty blockers in the care pathways for trans young people. We recognise that this may be destressing news for some colleagues who are parents, guardians, friends, family or loved ones of those affected by this news. 

T﻿he CS LGBT+ Network has a Parents, Carers and Partners group of Vice Chairs, details of this group are on the 'Team' page. Furthermore where they exist in your area of the Civil Service, there are mental health first aiders and or access to PAM assist, or other employee assistance programmes. Please do not hesitate to reach out to your manager to understand what support is available in addition to the aforementioned places.
