Last week we launched our award winning Mentoring Programme for it’s second year. Over 250 of you have already signed up to be mentees and close to 200 have signed up to be mentors. Registration is open for another 3 and a half weeks and we are keen to increase those numbers and have as many of you as possible sign up. 

If you have already signed up for the programme why not come along to an induction session? Whatever your grade, location, department or LGBT+ identity, you can come along and find out more about becoming a mentor or a mentee. Whether you took part last year and want to find out what’s changed, or are have signed up for the first time, there will be something for everyone. The induction sessions are optional so don’t worry if you can’t make one of the sessions, but we would encourage you to come along if you can! If you’ve not signed up for our programme yet you can still come along to an induction session and find out more about what makes our programme award-winning.
