Applications for the Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme have been extended and will now close on **Friday 24 June**. This is your last chance to apply!

The Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme is the only cross-government mentoring programme that is exclusively for staff who have a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or variations in sex characteristics. Last year, the programme won a Civil Service Award for Developing and Supporting People.

So far, over 850 people have applied for the programme; meaning it's even bigger than last year's programme.

You can register either as a mentee, mentor or both. We are particularly looking for more mentors to join the programme.

**Who can take part**

In order to take part in this yearâ€™s mentoring programme, either as a mentee or as a mentor, you must:

* be a civil servant working in an organisation that is part of the UK Civil Service or the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales
* have a minority sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or have variations in sex characteristics (LGBT+)

If you want to be a mentor, your Civil Service grade or pay band must be equivalent to Administrative Officer (AO) or higher.

If you want to be a mentee, your Civil Service grade or pay band must be equivalent to Director (SCS2) or lower.

If you took part in the 2021 mentoring programme, you are allowed to take part in the 2022 programme as well.
