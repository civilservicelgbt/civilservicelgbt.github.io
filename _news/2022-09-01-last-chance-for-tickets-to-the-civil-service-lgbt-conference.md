The Civil Service LGBT+ Conference is taking place on 6 October 2022.

If you want to attend the conference, we are releasing a final wave of tickets on Monday 5 September at 10:00.

You can secure your place by registering on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/civil-service-lgbt-conference-2022-tickets-398936779647). 

## Not working on Monday?

You can access the event booking system via a personal device if you are not working on Monday. 

Please ensure you register using your work email address, even if you are using a personal device. This helps us confirm you are a civil servant.

## Reserve list and other ways to take part

Demand for the conference is high, and not everyone will get a place. If you don't secure a ticket, you can add yourself to a reserve list after all tickets are sold out.

Alternatively, you can take part in a virtual conference, covering similar content, later this year.
