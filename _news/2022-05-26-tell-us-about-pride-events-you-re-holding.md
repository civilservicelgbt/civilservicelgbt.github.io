Pride season is nearly here! We're excited to see the Civil Service LGBT+ Network participating in Pride marches all across the UK this summer. We'll also have socials and events, both in-person and virtual, to come along to in celebration of the season.

## Advertise your Pride events through the CS LGBT+ website

Does your department have an event happening for Pride season (virtual or in-person), that you'd like to advertise to civil servants in other departments?

Fill in the details of your event using [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO2ySzJCd6KEGjyVYYYJA3yMH_9ECvc_Ry0eqfpREzu7Ff6g/viewform?usp=sf_link) to advertise it on our website.

## Get involved 

Do you have any ideas for cross-Civil Service virtual events for Pride season, or would you be interested in helping organise them?

If so, please contact <Astrid.Crowley@cabinetoffice.gov.uk> about getting involved.
