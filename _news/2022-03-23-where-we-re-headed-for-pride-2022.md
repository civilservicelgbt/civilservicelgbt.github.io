The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating this year’s nationwide Pride participation for the Civil Service, alongside an online programme of events this summer.

We’ve chosen these locations because you said you wanted us to go to these pride events, and because we have identified local volunteers to lead coordination locally. If you don’t see a location here but you’d like to lead on organising attendance for the Civil Service there please [get in touch](mailto:marc.fitchett@civilservice.lgbt) and join our regular [pride organising forum](/event/2022/05/09/civil-service-pride-organising-forum).

## Register to attend

**Registrations to join the Civil Service at these pride events are now open.**

**If the local pride event has confirmed a date for their parade**, you can register to attend all of these events, or enter a ticket where there are restrictions on the numbers of people who can enter the parade. 

**Some pride events aren’t yet confirmed and may not go ahead.** If they do go ahead, once a date is confirmed we’ll add the event to our Pride event calendar on the [topic page](/topic/pride). You can pre-register for these events and we’ll email you to confirm the date when we know it.

Please register via the [Pride topic page](/topic/pride) if you’d like to attend. 

## Keeping PrideON

We’ll be releasing more information regularly; make sure you’re signed up for email alerts and checking the Pride topic page.

We’ll also letting you know about our digital programme of events soon too. Keep checking back for more details.

We look forward to celebrating pride with you, in person or online, later this year.
