The Civil Service LGBT+ Network and a:gender have developed a [tool](https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/preview/?sm=jzxMHwm7PLM4AbQOPmvvN_2F2Bx25cfzOVN1UT5uHuwfM_3D) to record instances of [bullying, harassment](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-bullying-and-harassment) and [discrimination](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights) (BHD) experienced or witnessed by lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, queer, trans, non-binary and intersex colleagues. We would also like to hear from friends, relatives, and allies who work for the Civil Service. We have created this in response to anecdotal evidence of a recent increase in BHD towards LGBT+ staff, particularly for trans, non-binary and intersex colleagues.

## **What is bullying and harassment?**

[Bullying and harassment](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-bullying-and-harassment) is unwanted behaviour that makes someone feel intimidated or offended, or could be described as an abuse or misuse of power that undermines, humiliates, or causes physical or emotional harm to someone.

Bullying and harassment might:

* be a regular pattern of behaviour or a one-off incident
* happen face-to-face, on social media, in emails or calls
* happen at work or in other work-related situations
* not always be obvious or noticed by others

It's possible someone might not know their behaviour is bullying or harassing. It can still be bullying or harassment even if they do not realise it or do not intend to bully someone. The Equality Act 2010 is the legislation that defines what behaviours could constitute harassment.

## Report incidents of bullying, harassment or discrimination

You can report an incident of bullying, harassment or discrimination online using our tool.

> [Report an incident online](https://www.surveymonkey.com/create/preview/?sm=jzxMHwm7PLM4AbQOPmvvN_2F2Bx25cfzOVN1UT5uHuwfM_3D)

This reporting tool does not have a closing date and provides an ongoing way for colleagues to record instances of bullying, harassment or discrimination.

### How your data will be handled

Your responses are confidential and will only be visible to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network’s Trans and Non-binary inclusion team and a:gender executive committee. Responses will be aggregated and used to identify key themes or issues. Findings generated from this data will be shared with Civil Service HR and the HR and Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Teams within Civil Service departments, bodies or agencies. We will use statistical disclosure control methods to ensure no data is shared that could identify any individual person or incident.

**No direct action will be taken about the incident being reported** as a result of using this tool. If you require support with a specific BHD incident please contact your HR team, a trade union representative, departmental LGBT+ network or your department’s Employee Assistance Service. 

If you have any other questions please contact [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt).
