This year’s pride applications are now live. The one form can be used to apply to join us at all of the pride parades, all pride events are listed on the '[Pride 2024](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/pride-2024/)' page. Find the form in any of the pride events on our website. 

Some of the parades will be balloted. At the moment we think that this will be Pride in London and Manchester Pride. However, depending on uptake of other parades others may also go to a ballot, if this is the case a note will be added to that events page. 

F﻿or all balloted Prides notification will be given 6 weeks from the event if you have been successful or not. Balloted prides are difficult and it is not fun letting people know that they have not been successful. If you have been successful, but your plans have changed, please do get in touch with your local organiser and let them know, so that your space can be reallocated. 

F﻿or any of the pride events you register for, please ensure you let your local organiser know if you are no longer going to attend, this helps us all plan for the day.

Full details will be added to all pride event pages in due course. If you have any questions, please do get in touch with your '[Local Organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/)'. If you or your local Civil Service Department Networks are organising something for pride and would like it advertised wider, then please do get in touch with [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](pride2024@civilservice.lgbt).
