Pride events across the UK are back. The Civil Service will be attending Pride events across the UK, led by the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Registrations are open to attend these events in person.

## Register to attend

You can register to attend by completing our registration form.

**The registration form is a Google Form.** You may not be able to access it from a work device. You can use a personal device to complete the form if you cannot access it from your work device.

Some Pride events place limits on the number of people who can go into each group in their parade. For those events, you will be placed into a lottery and we will contact you 4 weeks in advance of the event to confirm your place.

## Locations

All of the locations we are planning to attend are listed on our [Pride topic page](/pride).

## Questions

If you have any questions about our plans for Pride, you can attend our Pride Organisers Forum – dates are listed on our [events page](/events) – or you can send us an email at <info@civilservice.lgbt>
