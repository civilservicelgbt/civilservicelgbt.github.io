We're pleased to introduce **Groups**: a new, more informal way of staying up to date with the work of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and our teams of volunteers.

**Groups** are email-based distribution lists. You can sign up in minutes, just by sending an email. Once you're subscribed, you will receive regular emails directly from our volunteers about things you might be interested in. If you change your mind later, you can unsubscribe again just by sending an email.

## Groups are different from email alerts

You can already sign up for [email alerts](/join-us) via our website. Email alerts are semi-automated emails that notify you when things are added to our website. **Groups** are different; they include wider topics, informal discussion, and allow a bit more of a two-way conversation.

##Â Our first Group

Our first **Group** is the "North West Group", for civil servants who are based in the North West region. This **Group** is managed by [Ross](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/ross-starkie/) and [Matt](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/matt-walker) from our North West local organiser team. We'll be adding more Groups over time for more regions, nations and project teams.

## Join a Group

To find out more, and to subscribe to one of the **Groups**, visit [www.civilservice.lgbt/groups](/groups).
