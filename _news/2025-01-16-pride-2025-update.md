A﻿s we enter into the New Year questions are starting to be asked on where the Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be in 2025. We are hoping to build on the experience and scope of Pride 2024, offering more pride parades and social occasions at a variety of pride events. When we are ready to launch there will be a sign up form for all events.

E﻿vents are being uploaded onto the website when there is confirmation of dates and local organiser commitment. Registration will open when our plans are in place. 

S﻿ome of the parades will be balloted as numbers are restricted; last year Manchester and London were balloted prides. We know that this process does not please everyone, but it has appeared to have been the fairest way to allocate spaces. Reserve lists will be run for balloted prides. Ballots for prides will be done 6 and a half weeks in advance of the parade. 

I﻿t is important for Local Organisers to understand if you can no longer make a certain pride event, please ensure you tell them via email prior to the event. This will ensure we have the correct stock of Civil Service LGBT+ t-shirts and will mean that Local Organisers are not spending time looking for people that are not turning up.

T﻿o ensure that we are as sustainable and economic as possible we will be using the same colour and design of t-shirts and banners as last year.

A﻿ll parades and events will be added to the website [events](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/) page, as well as to the [Pride 2025](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/pride-2025/) Topics page. Until timings, meeting location and other finer details are confirmed all events will show as starting at 1200, when details are confirmed this will be explicitly noted on each event.

If your local Civil Service Department are organising something for pride and would like it advertised wider then please do get in touch with the pride co-ordinator on [pride2025@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2025@civilservice.lgbt) or via your [Local Organiser](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/).
