Earlier this month, we launched our [mentoring programme](/mentoring) for its second year. We had very positive feedback from last week’s Programme, with the majority of 2021-22 mentors and mentees saying that they had a positive experience from the Programme. We’re also delighted that some mentors and mentees will be continuing their mentoring relationship this year.

In fact, some of last year’s mentors enjoyed the programme so much, over half of those who completed the end of programme survey said that they expect to apply for the 2022-23 Mentoring Programme. But why should you join the hundreds number of colleagues who’ve already signed up, and become a mentor on this year’s mentoring programme?

Here’s just some of the feedback from last year’s mentors:

> This was an excellent scheme and brilliantly run. The support from the LGBT+ Network was fantastic. Really excited about how we grow the scheme. I am really proud to be part of this, and it is a worthy Civil Service Awards winner!

> An extremely well organised and conceived programme.

> I really enjoyed supporting colleagues and especially under represented colleagues gain development or promotion.

> It was an excellent and much needed programme and I was super proud to be involved with.

If that’s not enough, Rachel, a mentor on last year’s programme, shares the skills she gained from her experience:

> Like many, my career successes have been built upon the good advice and encouragement, feedback and support, that I’ve been fortunate enough to receive from senior leaders across the Civil Service. Being a mentor is a great opportunity to “pay it forward” and help someone else take that next step on their own journey. It’s increased my self-confidence that I have something valuable to offer others, and helped develop my listening and questioning skills. 
> 
> It’s also provided me with fresh perspectives on challenges and barriers people might be facing, and to reflect on how I can address these in my own work environment. It’s been great to expand my network and learn from others through the mentoring experience – and I’m looking forward to meeting my new mentees this year!

The mentoring mrogramme welcomes those who have previously mentored before, as well as those who are completely new to mentoring. Taking on feedback from last year’s Programme, we will be adapting our resources to ensure mentors feel fully-supported during the Programme. Mentors are the backbone of the Programme, and we will support you with the tools to get the most out of your mentoring experience.
