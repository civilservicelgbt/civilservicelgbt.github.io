Hello everyone, 

Iâ€™m excited and honoured to remain as a Vice Chair for our Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Over the past 2.5 years, you may have worked with me in supporting our regional teams and tasks. I want to thank you for your continuous support!

The three programmes that I feel very passionate about and will be leading on are:

- Face-to-face socials and networking
- Supporting local delivery
- Volunteer deal

Thanks to the hard work of our volunteers, our regional teams (local organisers) are growing from strength to strength. We now have dedicated teams of volunteers covering Scotland, Wales and large parts of England, including London, South East, South West, North East and North West. Our local organisers coordinate between their local department networks, help organise socials and events close to you. They are a vital part of our network.

We have an ambitious plan to expand our teams to cover all parts of the UK. If you are based in Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England or Northern Ireland and would like to support our network, we are very keen to speak to you. You can get in touch by emailing us at <info@civilservice.lgbt>.

We are very grateful for our local organisers and volunteers. We are working closely with Civil Service HR teams and the Civil Service LGB&TI Champion and will ensure your hard work and contribution is recognised.

So join us and be part for our exciting journey!

> If you would like to volunteer as a local organiser in your area, please email us at <info@civilservice.lgbt>
