Registrations for the 2022 round of the [Civil Service LGBT+ mentoring programme](/mentoring) have now closed. 

## Check your details

If you successfully registered, you will receive an email on 27 June 2022 asking you to check the information you provided when you registered. 

If your:

- **information is correct**, you do not need to do anything; wait for your matches to be sent to you later
- **information is wrong**, reply to the email telling us what you need to update

You have until 30 June at 23:59 to check your information is accurate.

## Matching takes place on 1 July 2022

We will use the information you provided to conduct the matching process on 1 July 2022.

You should receive your matches before Tuesday 5 July 2022. These will be sent to the same email address you registered with.

## If you don't receive your matches

If you don't receive your matches by Friday 8 July 2022, please email us at <mentoring@civilservice.lgbt>. 

**Please do not email us before this date**; there are almost 1,000 participants on the programme, and only 3 of us managing queries. 

## If you missed the deadline

If you didn't register before the deadline, you will need to wait until the next round of the programme takes place. This is likely to be in early 2023.

Our matching process means that all registered participants get matched at exactly the same time; once that's done, it's not possible to add new mentees or mentors into the process.
