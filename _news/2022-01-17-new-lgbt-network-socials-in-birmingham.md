Cadbury’s chocolate, the Balti, more canals than Venice… and now the newest location for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network's socials! 

We will be meeting in Birmingham on the first Thursday of every month, starting in February at the Old Joint Stock which is just next to the cathedral. 

I'm looking forward to creating a new local community of LGBT+ civil servants. All are welcome!
