We are electing a new chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network; and it could be you!

As Chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network, you could define an exciting, transformative agenda; lead a diverse team; develop new skills; and change the Civil Service for the better.

## How you can be the chair 

The Chair is an elected post. It's elected via an 'electoral college' system, where each department or agency gets one vote. Each organisation, in turn, must hold its own internal vote to decide who it will support.

## Submit your nomination

To stand in the election, you need to get nominated.

Your nomination must send an email from your Civil Service email address to <election@civilservice.lgbt> before the close of nominations on 12 May 2023 at 23:59, containing the following information:

- your full name
- your current Civil Service employer
- the name of at least one sponsor for your nomination – they must also be copied into the email and be eligible to act as a sponsor ([you can find out more about this in the election rules](/election/2023/rules#your-sponsor)
- a personal statement of no more than 500 words – this statement will be published on the Civil Service LGBT+ Network website
- a portrait photograph that will be published alongside your statement on the Civil Service LGBT+ Network website
