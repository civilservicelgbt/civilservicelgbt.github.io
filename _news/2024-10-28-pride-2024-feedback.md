### Foreword Notes

T﻿he Network was planning on attend 20 events, including all Nations capital cities. Approval was given for the Network to enter walking groups only. Manchester, for the 3rd year running, was the largest attended pride with approximately 170 people parading. Only one of the planned events was not attended due to safety concerns. We had approximately 700 people sign up to join the Network across the UK. This was sign up increase of approximately 8% from 2023.

F﻿ollowing pride we collected feedback, both quantitative and qualitative, so that we can understand the positives as well as gleam areas for improvements moving forward. It was great to see that, on the whole, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Feedback from last year helped shape how this year was managed, and based on the quantitative data it shows that there were improvements across the board for ease of sign up, communications and more.

### Registration and Ballot

E﻿nsuring we get registration and balloting correct is really important and not an easy feat. This year, again, members registered all through one form. Forms could be amended if there were any changes to planned prides, based on feedback though, this could have been better advertised, this is something we will make clearer for 2025.

T﻿here were 2 prides that were balloted this year, Manchester and London. Spaces are always over subscribed and limited, either because of funding, or from the parade teams themselves. Local Organisers worked hard to ensure all spaces were filled, and members were informed 6 weeks form the parade if they had been successful. We know that this process can be disappointing for some, and some have suggested not having a ballot at all, but managing expectations then would be far too tough. 

### Attending Pride

T﻿he Local Organisers worked extremely hard this season to ensure that participants had a safe and enjoyable day. Work that they put in is voluntary and in their own downtime, I am extremely grateful for the work that they do, not just at pride, but all year round.

T﻿here were some changes in the way communications were made this year, based on the feedback this appears to have had a positive impact. We are aware there is still some work to do, including ensuring that certain departmental firewalls on emails aren't blocking other departments emails.

L﻿ots of the feedback in this section has been positive, highlighting the great work the Local Organisers do, there have been some comments around the t-shirts being the same as previous years, or being asked to wear the t-shirts etc. The t-shirts have remained the same for the last few years, apart from a small run of pale pink t-shirts a few years ago (due to stocking issues). This enables the Network and its members to reuse and recycle t-shirts so that we are more sustainable and cost effective. 

I﻿ know that there is also some disappointment with lack of float or parade entry sizes, especially with regards to London, parade entry numbers are limited by London Pride for each entry, our entries have been limited by budget. In addition, this year, we had approval to enter only walking groups into parades, had we not been restricted in this way a float would have exceed all budget and more. 

### F﻿inal Thoughts

W﻿e have received over 100 feedback forms and these will all help shape a better experience for those hoping to attend Pride 2025 with the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. 

Whilst Pride 2024 season might be over there is still so much going on in the Network, our Local Organisers deliver throughout the year, whether that's book club, socials, cinema trips, picnics, walks and more.
