For our twentieth anniversary, we're looking back at the impact of staff networks on LGBT+ inclusion, and how the Civil Service has changed to be a better place for LGBT+ staff.

## Help us capture moments that mattered to you

The Civil Service is a markedly different place to work than it was 20 years ago if you're LGBT+. It has changed and evolved; and it still is. 

Today, for most, your sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or other characteristics isn't a blocker to building a career or making the Civil Service your home. 

That journey – the journey of LGBT+ diversity and inclusion – was built on the backs of people determined to make things better. **We want to capture what they did, so it isn't forgotten.**

## We're creating a time capsule

Later this year, we're going to create a space, online, where we can keep the unofficial history of LGBT+ diversity and inclusion in the Civil Service. We want it to be filled with stories, photos, testimonials, "thank-yous" and more; all showcasing the efforts people made and impact it has had.

We don't know exactly what we're going to create yet, but **we want you to be part of it.** 

## Send us your memories

We want your stories and memories to be part of this unofficial history. **We've created a new inbox – <history@civilservice.lgbt> – for you to send us things you think should be part of the story.**

Perhaps you took some great photos at a Pride event. Or you wrote a diary entry on a day you got that promotion. Or you made a friend for life an event organised by your department. Maybe you want to say 'thanks' to someone that gave you the push to get that promotion.

We want to hear from as many people as possible. Current civil servants. Members of our network. LGBT+ staff. Network chairs. Our volunteers. Former volunteers. LGBT+ allies. Champions. Former or retired civil servants. If you've played a part, or you've felt the impact of someone else who has, we'd love to capture it in this new archive and celebration of inclusion.

It doesn't matter what it is, we want to hear about it.

> Whatever you are contribution, send it to us before 31 July 2023 by emailing <history@civilservice.lgbt>.

## What will happen to your stuff?

We'll decide how we'll present this new archive of LGBT+ inclusion once we've seen the kinds of things being contributed to it. 

Our intention is to make the content publicly accessible, so please only share things that you are comfortable being put on to the open internet. If you're sending us things about someone else, you should ask them too, if you can.
