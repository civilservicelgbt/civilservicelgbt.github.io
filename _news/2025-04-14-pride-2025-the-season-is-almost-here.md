Our season kicks off earlier than ever this year with Birmingham Pride! We are all over the UK too including Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle, Doncaster and many more. We still have a couple of new prides being added - Still to go live this week is South Lanarkshire and Bute. 

E﻿ach parade has its own sign up link in the event page for the parades. All events and prides can be found on the events page - [Events](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/events/).

O﻿ur pride parades are run by our wonderful local organisers, if you sign up and can no longer attend, please do let them know. A list of your Local Organisers can be found on the CS LGBT+ Network [Team](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/) page.
