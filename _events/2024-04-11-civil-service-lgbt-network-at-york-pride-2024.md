**Y﻿ork Pride**

York Pride stands as the pinnacle of York's cultural celebrations — a vibrant, annual extravaganza that heralds the beauty of diversity within the LGBT+ community. As the largest event of its kind in North Yorkshire, and notably the biggest free one-day event York has to offer, it serves as both a jubilant celebration and a vital platform for raising awareness about key LGBT+ issues.

This event shines as a beacon of inclusivity, where visibility, entertainment and joy are interwoven with the spirit of unity. It's a day where families, friends, and allies come together in a harmonious display of support, creating an uplifting atmosphere where everyone is encouraged to be their authentic selves.

**M﻿uster & T-shirt Information**

Please muster at York Museum Gardens between 1045 - 1115, please bear in mind it may take a few minutes to find us and sort out any remaining t-shirts, so arrive in plenty of time. 

T-shirt collection will be held on Friday 31 May at our pre-pride social event (full details on the [website](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-04-29-york-pride-pre-social-t-shirt-collection/)). If you’re unable to make this event please let us know, and we will bring your t-shirt on the day.

**P﻿arade Route Information**

York Pride Parade is a route that covers over 2.5km – making it one of the longest across the United Kingdom – and transits the City Centre and neighbouring Race Course. Please ensure you bring comfortable shoes (there will be cobbles and uneven surfaces along the route).

**P﻿ost Parade**

The Parade will terminate at the Knavesmire Race Course, where a festival-style pride event will take place (including bars, marketplace, main-stage, and a funfair). The local organising team will be positioned close to the main-bar throughout the afternoon, identifiable by our CS LGBT+ Banner, please feel free to join us or do your own thing once the parade has ended.

NB: If you are doing your own thing, please remove your CS LGBT+ t-shirt (you can keep it, or we can take it back from you) before heading off for the afternoon.
