Our London Women’s Inclusion team would love to invite you to join them at the Science Museum Lates. This event is open to everyone who identifies as a woman and/or feels like this space would be suitable for them.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join Maria and Oriana from 18:30 in the Energy Café. Both will be there until 19:45 before they start to explore the museum. At that time you are then free to experience the museums exhibits with them or in small groups.

The event takes place from 18:30 to 22:00, 29 March at the Science Museum, London. Tickets are free and need to be booked on the [Science Museum Website](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/lates). 

Please note, access to the Science Museum is also open to all members of the public and is not a women focused event.  

Please do get in contact should you have any questions or feedback – [maria.ionescu@governmentlegal.gov.uk ](maria.ionescu@governmentlegal.gov.uk)and [oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk](oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk)
