The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on Saturday marching in London Trans+ Pride 2024.

We will meet around St. Martin’s Courtyard (further meet up details will be sent out to those signed up closer to the time) which should be quieter before we head to Trafalgar Square where the main crowds will be gathering from 1pm. The march will set off at 2pm. It will continue up Cockspur Street onto Pall Mall. The procession will turn right at Waterloo Place before proceeding on to Piccadilly Circus. It will then turn left and continue straight onto Wellington Arch. The total distance of the march is 1.35 miles and London Trans+ Pride organisers estimate it will take one to one and a half hours to walk.

There are no restrictions on the amount of people who can come along to the march so feel free to bring along friends and family to join us. Please also bring along water to keep yourself hydrated during the march. We aim to have a fun, supportive space so we’ll have face paints, glitter, and flowers in our hair. There is no requirement to stay for the full march either.  

For access information, toilets on route, route maps, etc, please refer to London Trans Pride Facebook and Instagram accounts. You can also email [access@londontranspride.org](mailto:access@londontranspride.org) for further accessibility requirements you may have.
