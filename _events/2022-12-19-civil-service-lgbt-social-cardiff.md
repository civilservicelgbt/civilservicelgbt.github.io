Join other LGBTQ+ civil servants and public sector staff at our first social of 2023 at Cardiff's Queer Emporium.


The Emporium serves cocktails, mocktails, hot drinks and a limited selection of vegan/vegetarian cold food, and is fully accessible.


We generally move on to a secondary venue after 6pm if there's interest, so don't forget to let us know if you're coming late and we'll keep you updated!
