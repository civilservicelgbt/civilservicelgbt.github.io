We’re watching LGBT themed films in the Prince Charles Cinema, just by Leicester Square (7 Leicester Place, London WC2H 7BY - edge of Chinatown)

You do not need to register for this event, you can just turn up. However you will need to purchase your own ticket. Tickets sell out fast so please ensure you purchase in advance - there is no guarantee that tickets will be available in the box office.

This month we’re watching Persona (1966), the avant-garde psychological drama written, directed and produced by Ingmar Bergman. The film focuses on a stage actress named Elisabet, who after losing the ability to speak retires to an isolated beach house with her nurse Alma – and what happens to their identities as a result.

A pre-meet is available at 17:40 in the big Pret-a-Manger by Leicester Square tube station (77-78 St Martin’s Ln, London WC2N 4AA), and we’ll head over to Prince Charles Cinema at 18:00 (with an opportunity to pick up snacks on the way). You can spot the CS LGBT+ rep by their red hat!

The screening starts at 18:05. After the film we’ll be heading round the corner to Ku Bar (30 Lisle St, London WC2H 7BA) for an opportunity to discuss the film.

17:40 - Pre meet - Pret-a-Manger

17:50 - Head to Prince Charles Cinema

18:05 - Film starts

Afterwards - Ku Bar

Accessibility: Regrettably the Prince Charles Cinema is not a fully accessible venue. There is a ramp to get into the foyer, but this film is screened on the upstairs screen - there are 20 steps up and, once you get into the screen, further steps to each row. If you sit in the back row you can avoid any further steps.

There are 20 steps down from the foyer to the bar, where the bathrooms are. From the bar, the men’s is step-free while the women’s has one step and a sharp corner that a wheelchair could not access. Regrettably, there are not single occupancy toilets on the premises.
