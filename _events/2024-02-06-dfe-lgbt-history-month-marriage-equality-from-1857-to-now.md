2024 marks 10 years since the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act came into force, extending the right to marry to gay and lesbian couples across England and Wales - but this is just one step in the journey of marriage equality.

This session from the DfE LGBT+ Network will look at a brief history of marriage, including the historic rights of women within marriage, the differences between the various flavours of marriage and civil partnership around today, and what that means for LGBT+ people now.
