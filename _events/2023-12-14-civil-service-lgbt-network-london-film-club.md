[The Prince Charles Cinema | QUEEN CHRISTINA](https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/WhatsOn?f=29263546)

This month we’re watching Queen Christina (1933), starring Greta Garbo. A pre-code Hollywood production that served as a ground breaking portrayal of varying gender roles, the film is laced with meaning around fluidity of gender and sexuality in its depiction of a real historical figure that did not neatly fit into contemporary categories. 

A pre-meet is available at 17:45 in the big Pret-a-Manger by Leicester Square tube station (77-78 St Martin’s Ln, London WC2N 4AA), and we’ll head over to Prince Charles Cinema at 18:00 (with an opportunity to pick up snacks on the way). The screening starts at 18:15. After the film we’ll be heading round the corner to Ku Bar (30 Lisle St, London WC2H 7BA) for an opportunity to discuss the film.

Accessibility: Regrettably the Prince Charles Cinema is not a fully accessible venue. There is a ramp to get into the foyer, but this film is screened on the upstairs screen - there are 20 steps up and, once you get into the screen, further steps to each row. If you sit in the back row you can avoid any further steps.

There are 20 steps down from the foyer to the bar, where the bathrooms are. From the bar, the men’s is step-free while the women’s has one step and a sharp corner that a wheelchair could not access. Regrettably, there are not single occupancy toilets on the premises.
