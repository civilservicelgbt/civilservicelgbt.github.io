Pride Day: We are running a joint pre-Pride breakfast with the Welsh Government from 9am at the City United Reform Church in Windsor Place, to raise funds for LGBT+ charity Hoops and Loops, based at the church and supporting LGBT+ refugees and asylum seekers in Cardiff. (The breakfast itself is free but there will be opportunities to donate to H&L while there.) This will also be where marchers can pick up their t-shirts should they wish to.

We will then be walking together to join the parade from the church. Rest of the joining instructions are below – we may move ‘colours’ in order to march near Welsh Government (this is currently being confirmed by WG).

If anyone wants to join the march after the cut-off date on the website, please invite them to contact me directly at Bethan.Cable@gov.wales. This also applies to the pre-Pride social on Wednesday 14th, as there is a limited amount of space at the Queer Emporium and we may go on elsewhere afterwards!
