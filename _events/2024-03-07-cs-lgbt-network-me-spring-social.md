You're cordially invited to join us for a delightful Spring social gathering on 30th May 2024. After what feels like an eternity, it's time to come together and celebrate in person! Join us for a heart-warming gathering.

W﻿e'll confirm the venue closer to the time - we're keen to meet somewhere than a pub/bar, so we'll keep you posted!

Connect face to face with fellow members of the CS LGBT+ Network ethnic minority community and allies. 

S﻿ee you there!
