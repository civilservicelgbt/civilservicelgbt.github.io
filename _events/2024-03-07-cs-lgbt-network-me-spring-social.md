\*This was initially an in person social but due to network leadership changes, this event will now be a virtual MS Teams social.\*

 

You're cordially invited to join us for a delightful Spring social gathering on 25th April 2024. After what feels like an eternity, it's time to get together for a catch up with members, old and new!

 

Grab a beverage of your choice and join our laid back virtual social to decompress after a long day at work. Come along and connect virtually with fellow members of the CS LGBT+ Network ethnic minority community and allies.

S﻿ee you there!
