**P﻿lan for the day**

For the Saturday parade meet up with Martin and Steven in Spoons HQ the Five Swans Pub opposite the Newcastle City Council Civic Centre from 11.00 hrs or if late make your own way to the civic centre which is the **official muster point** and try and find our group resplendent in our pink Civil Service T Shirts and/or possibly carrying a banner along with hundreds of others. 

**You need to be at the muster point no later than 11.30** as there is likely to be a queue to join the main parade which starts at 12.00 hrs, we will filter in into the main parade as it passes by.

After the parade we would love to hold people together to take a large group photo provided everyone gives consent. We will inform people of where on the day.

There is a 3-year Public Spaces Protection order in force relating to the consumption of alcohol in specific areas within the city of Newcastle and the police or council enforcement officers may issue a fixed penalty notice, thus drinking alcohol whilst on the parade is not recommended. No food, glass bottles and alcoholic drinks are to be brought into the main arena apart from sealed plastic water bottles under 500ml, one per person.  If you bring an opened bottle to the entrance this will be removed upon bag search.  There are free water refills across the arena.

**Accessibility Guidance**

Please be aware that although the main arena will be slightly larger this year it remains a small area, there may be large crowds and space could be tight.

There are no accessibility problems envisaged.  The main arena will be accessible without any stepped areas, the only area that will have steps is the balcony area.

All official partner venues, are step free, fully accessible and have the required access services needed including disabled toilets. This includes all festival zones and the Pride Arena. Some key venues, also provide some quiet spaces for those that need some time away from the pride celebrations.

The free shuttle bus will be back and will stop at key locations to improve community members experience, whilst accessing as many of the festival attractions as they can. ​​
