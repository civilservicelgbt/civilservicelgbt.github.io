Hi all,

 

Given the summer, it's been a few months since we've had a virtual social so what better time to start than with Black History Month! We will revisit the best films, music, podcasts and books of Black artists, creatives and authors that you'd like to recommend and share.

 

Grab a beverage of your choice and join our laid back virtual social to decompress after a long day at work. Come along and connect virtually with fellow members of the CS LGBT+ Network ethnic minority community and allies.

 

S﻿ee you there!

Claire
