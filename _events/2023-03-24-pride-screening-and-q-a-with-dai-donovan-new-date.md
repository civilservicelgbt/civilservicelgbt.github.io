To celebrate LGBT+ History Month the Welsh Government's LGBTI+ Network PRISM is co-hosting a screening of the 2014 movie Pride!. Pride! is the inspirational true story of the LGBTQ+ activists who helped to support miners and their families during the 1984/85 miners' strike. We're also delighted to say that Dai Donovan, one of the real people on whom the film was based, has agreed to join us for a Q&A following the film.

The film will begin at 17:00 sharp, so please ensure you arrive in good time.

All are welcome - you're very welcome to bring your partners and/or family too (although if bringing children, please bear in mind the film has a 15-certificate). If you will be bringing family members, please ensure you add their names to the form as well so that we can ensure you're all able to enter the building.
