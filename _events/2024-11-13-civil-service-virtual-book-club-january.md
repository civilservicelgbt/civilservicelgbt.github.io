🌈 Join the vibrant world of literature and inclusivity with our Virtual LGBT+ Book Club! 📚🏳️‍🌈 Immerse yourself in a welcoming online community where diverse voices and stories take centre stage. From ground-breaking classics to contemporary gems, our club celebrates the rich tapestry of LGBTQ+ literature. Connect with like-minded individuals across the Civil Service, sharing insights and fostering meaningful discussions on the power of queer narratives.

Each month you will be given the choice of 5 books and you can vote for your favourite and whichever book gets the most votes we will read together and then end of the month we will meet up online and discuss our thoughts on the book.
