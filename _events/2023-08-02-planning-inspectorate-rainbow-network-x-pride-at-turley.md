Turley is one of the largest and longest-established planning and development consultancies in the UK. They relaunched Pride at Turley, their staff LGBT+ Network in June this year, to connect LGBT+ co-owners and allies; hold events and create safe spaces; create an even more inclusive culture working closely with our leadership and People & Culture team; and raise awareness of LGBTQ+ issues and topics and Turley’s progress in these areas.  The PINS’ Rainbow Network is delighted to hold a joint meeting with Neil Woodhouse and Ben Wood, Pride at Turley leads, to discuss diversity and LGBT+ inclusion in the planning and development industry, plus staff networks in the public and private sectors.
