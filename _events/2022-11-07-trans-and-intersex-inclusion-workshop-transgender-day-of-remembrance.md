The workshop covers the following topics:

• Understanding what the terms ‘trans’, ‘intersex’ and ‘nonbinary’ mean,

• How to use appropriate terminology and language,

• A brief overview of relevant legislation,

• Recognising the issues that trans and intersex colleagues might face in the workplace and wider society,

• And exploring how to support trans and intersex colleagues in the workplace.

This workshop will be presented by members of a:gender, the national cross-government network for trans and intersex staff.



The target audience is civil servants of all grades and roles, but we suggest that the following staff will find the package particularly helpful:

• line managers and senior leaders,

• HR, security, communications and IT personnel,

• D&I champions,

• bullying and harassment advisors

This will be a hybrid meeting. More details please follow the registration link.
