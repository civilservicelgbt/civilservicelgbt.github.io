The Rainbow Network is delighted to welcome Daryn Carter MBE, Director of Programming and Partnerships at Bristol Pride. Daryn will talk about the history and relevance of Bristol Pride, and why Pride is important to him.

The Planning Inspectorate is also sponsoring Bristol Pride 2023 in order to further our outreach as well as equality aims. This meeting will add value to that sponsorship, allow colleagues to learn more about Bristol Pride and give Daryn an opportunity to meet us. All welcome! Please contact [Jeanie Russell](mailto:jean.russell.6g@planninginspectorate.gov.uk) for more details or the Teams link.
