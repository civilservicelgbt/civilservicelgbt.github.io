The London LGBT+ team invite you to join them at the first lates at Tate Modern. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 18:00 at the Corner Cafe, Natalie Bell Building, Level 1, Tate modern. We will be there until 18:45 before we start to explore the museum. At that time you are then free to experience the museums exhibits with us or in small groups. 

The event takes place from 18:00 to 22:00. Tickets aren’t needed to enter the museum however some workshops and events do require booking. These can be booked on the website here if you’d like to attend these events, or collected at the Tanks Studio Level 0 from 17:30 on the day: [https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-modern-lates. ](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-modern-lates)

The organiser of the event is the museum themselves. Their accessibility information for the venue can be found in the above link, or full accessibility found here: <https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern#accessibility> . Specifically, for the Lates, ear defenders can be borrowed from the Ticket desks re loud music and the Quiet Room is Room 7, Level 4. If you have any concerns that would make it easier when coming to the event, please let the museum know, or let me know and I can pass this on to the museum if you’d like.  

Please note, access to the Museum is also open to all members of the public and is not an LGBT+ focused event. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit the Museum, they are most welcome to join.
