In this event, we will remember the gender diverse people around the world murdered for who they were. We'll learn about the work FCDO is doing internationally to make LGBT+ people safer and hear from Bee Bailey, a UK Police Officer who has been active around the world promoting trans inclusion and LGBT+ safety. This will be followed by a discussion and your chance to ask questions.
