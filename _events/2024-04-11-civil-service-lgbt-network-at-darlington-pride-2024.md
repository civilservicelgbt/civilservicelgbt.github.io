The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

Darlington Pride takes place over a number of days, our main focus as a Network is on the Saturday. For the Saturday parade meet up with Martin outside the muster point outside the Darlington Economic Campus by 11.30 at the latest to move on to the Market Square ready for the parade at 12.00 or alternately if you are would like to start early with a Pride breakfast Martin will be in Spoons HQ (the William Stead, 8 Crown Street, DL1 1LB)

Or make your own way to the Market Square which is the official muster point before12.00 hrs and try and find our group resplendent in our pink Civil Service T Shirts and/or possibly carrying a banner along with hundreds of others.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
