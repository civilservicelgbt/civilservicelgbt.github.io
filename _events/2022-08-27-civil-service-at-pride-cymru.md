The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Serviceâ€™s presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

## Joining instructions

### Cardiff Pride - Saturday 27th August 2022

Thank you for registering for Cardiff Pride. We hope that you have an amazing day with us.

For those who have registered to take part in the parade, then please meet at the City United Reform Church from 08:30 until 10:30. At the meeting point, you will be able to collect your t-shirt and also be able to purchase light breakfast snacks. 

[Meeting Point](https://goo.gl/maps/TxEMky3Bs3rb1biZ8). 

For the Parade, please meet at the 'Yellow' section on Windsor Place, CF10 3BZ by 10:30. The parade will start at 11am. 

The start of the parade will be at Queens Street near the Capitol Shopping Centre. The parade is scheduled to last for at least two hours.

[Pride Cymru information](https://www.pridecymru.com).

Once the parade is complete there will be an option to attend:

- Pride event at City Hall (tickets are required and these can be purchased on the gate, but please remember that there is no re-entry and you will have to pay again)
- the Big Queer Picnic in Sophia Gardens (Free)

## Rules of the Day

Please remember that you are representing the Civil Service and must follow the Civil Service Code, and Civil Service LGBT+ Network's Standards of Behaviour policy at all times especially when wearing the Civil Service t-shirts.

You are not allowed to drink alcohol on the streets in Cardiff so that also includes the parade. You will be able to drink alcohol at the Pride events or at a bar.

Happy Pride!
