The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This is the first in what will hopefully be a series of social events held in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Civil Service LGBT+ Network, so why not join us! Starting from 4pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northernireland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northernireland@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch! If turning up on the day just look out for the people wearing rainbow lanyards!
