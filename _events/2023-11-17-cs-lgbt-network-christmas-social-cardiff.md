The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Welsh Government LGBTI+ Network, PRISM. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on Tuesday 5 December for our Christmas Social?

We will be meeting at the South African War Memorial outside City Hall, Cardiff, to spend some time at Cardiff’s Winter Wonderland event. Admission is free and the Winter Wonderland is majority accessible (with the exception of some of the rides). There are funfair stalls, a ferris wheel, food stalls and more! If there’s continued interest, we will then make our way to Mary’s bar on St Mary Street for around 19:00. If you’d like to meet us there instead, you’re more than welcome!
