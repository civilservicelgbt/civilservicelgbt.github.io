Our London team invite you to join them for a night of comedy, followed by a visit to a local bar to chat. “My Dad Wears A Dress” is a comedic, one-woman show written and performed by Maria Telnikoff based on her own experience of growing up with a trans female parent. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 19:15 at the museum. The show starts at 19:30 and last the hour. Following the show, we will head to a local bar (subject to the group’s preferences) to chat.

Booking to the show is essential and tickets need to be bought individually (£5 - £10 each). Further details about it can be found on the Museum website '[here](https://www.outsavvy.com/event/16687/my-dad-wears-a-dress)'.

Please note, access to the show is also open to all members of the public. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit, they are also welcome to join.  

Please do get in contact with the event hosts should you have any questions or feedback / running late on the day – [Oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:Oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk) and [Maria.Ionescu@levellingup.gov.uk](mailto:Maria.Ionescu@levellingup.gov.uk).
