The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Our monthly West Midlands socials happen every first Thursday of the month, so why not join us! We will be at the venue from 5:30pm onwards and all civil servants are welcome to stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory but encouraged. When you arrive, look out for 'Liz' our inflatable unicorn mascot.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact the West Midlands local organisers.
