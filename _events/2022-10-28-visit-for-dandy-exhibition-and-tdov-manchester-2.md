Meet Matt 13:45-14:00 outside the gallery.

The Dandy Exhibition is a free event organised by the [Manchester Art Gallery](https://manchesterartgallery.org/). 

We are organising a visit for the exhibition then a coffee before going to Sackville Gardens for the TDOR Vigil (organised by the TDOR organisation). 

Please register so details can be shared as currently the TDOR vigil details have not announced. 

Matt will give his mobile and details will be shared in the Manchester WhatsApp group.
