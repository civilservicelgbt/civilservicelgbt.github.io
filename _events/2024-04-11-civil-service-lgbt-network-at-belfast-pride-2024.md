The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

We will be meeting at Lanyon Plaza from 10:30 on the day of the parade, breakfast will be provided courtesy of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Shortly before 12:00 we will begin to make our way to our position in the parade. 13:00 is parade start time and we are usually finished by 14:30, after which point, we all disperse and do our own thing.

Lanyon Plaza is a short distance from Lanyon Place train station. The building can be accessed from the front entrance, and we will be on the ground floor. This building is accessible.

We ask that you do make every effort to arrive at the muster point before we leave for the parade, however we know this can sometimes be out of an individuals control so once we get full information on our parade starting position we will update this section to reflect that.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
