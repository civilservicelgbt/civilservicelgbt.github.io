Join fellow Civil Servants for a trip to the Library of Birmingham this January for the tail end of the “Cover up Quilts” Exhibition. 

This is open to all Civil Servants in the LGBT+ Network and their supportive family & friends.

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants for a trip to the Library of Birmingham this January for the end of the “Cover up Quilts” Exhibition – inspired by the Names Project AIDS memorial, this community arts project involved artists working with 40 schools, patient and community groups to create quilts commemorating 40 years since the emergence of HIV and Aids.

The exhibition has run from Wed 15th Nov 2023, to Sat 13th January 2024 – we’ll be visiting on its last day. Free entry – the library opens from 11am, so we plan to meet up early and have a wander around, potentially with time for tea/coffee/lunch afterwards.
