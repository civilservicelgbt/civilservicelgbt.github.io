## Joining instructions

### Leeds Pride Event- Sunday 7th August 2022

Thank you for registering for Leeds Pride. We hope that you have an amazing day with us.

For those who have registered to take part in the parade, then please meet outside the East Entrance of Quarry House for 12:30 where you will have the opportunity to collect the CS LGBT+ T-Shirt. 

[Meeting point](https://goo.gl/maps/VSVdPYqRbWFgYR5J7). 

At 13:00 will walk together to Portland Crescent and Cookridge Street where the parade groups are assembling. At 14:00 the Parade will leave Millennium square and follows the Pride route to Lower Briggate where we will march as a group with the CS LGBT+ Network Banners. The Parade will end at Lower Briggate.

Once the Parade has finished, there is a table booked at the Adelphi from 3pm. If you would like to join the social after the parade then please contact <yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt>. There are also ticketed after-parties which you may want to attend, [Leeds Pride Information](https://leedspride.co.uk). For travel information then please visit [Transport for West Yorkshire](https://www.wymetro.com).

### Accessibility information

Leeds Pride is an outdoor event with the majority of the event space being hard surface highway or pavements. Some of this may be uneven or get wet in adverse conditions.

There will be a British Sign Language interpreter present on the Sainsbury’s Parade Stage and they will be located on the left as you look at the stage. Millennium Square has accessible toilet facilities on the site as well as also within the Leeds City Museum.

If you have any concerns about walking the route then please contact <yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt> in advance of the day.

### Rules for the day

Be kind and speak to everyone with respect - follow our [Standards of Behaviour](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/rules/standards-of-behaviour/).

If you’re planning on drinking alcohol after the parade, eat first and pace yourself as this will be a long event. The NHS One you - Drink Less App is perfect for keeping track on how much you’re drinking and spending.

Make sure that you bring along your own water bottle as near the market stalls in Lower Briggate there will be an opportunity for you to fill these up at the Yorkshire Water Bar and also make sure you have enough sunscreen with you. You should dress appropriately whilst taking part in the Civil Service group.

Apart from the start of the Parade there are no barriers along the route, so if you need to step out of the parade then please do so, but please be aware of any floats, vehicles and other people. The route does include a slight upward incline as it goes up the Headrow Towards Vicar Lane and then the downward incline on Vicar Lane, so please be aware of that and plan accordingly.

Please also remember to adhere to Civil Service Code and not promote any political messaging during the parade or do anything that might be perceived as jeopardising your impartiality.  

**We hope you have an amazing pride*
