Our London socials usually take place on the first Thursday of each month. Previous participants will know that these are usually in Westminster at the Retro Bar, but this is changed over the summer months (July, August and likely September).

Our event will be in St James's Park. We will initially meet at St James's Cafe and weather permitting will head outside to have an outdoor picnic, or otherwise stay in the cafe. For those who use what3words, here is a link to help us, though please note there may be slight differences in our location on the day: https://w3w.co/logo.jazz.upset. We will also have a pride flag to help identify us.

The cafe is accessible, as well as the toilet facilities. The closest accessible tube station is Westminster. The location is likely to be the same for all three months, but please check on this website a few days before each event to make sure. Please also note that we will not have a pre-meet event for park socials.

Feel free to bring whatever food you would like to have. Please let us know in advance if you have any food allergies, especially if they are severe enough to require other members not to bring specific food.

If you have any questions, an idea for a venue, or you’re willing to help organise a social yourself, please contact our [London local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/topic/london).
