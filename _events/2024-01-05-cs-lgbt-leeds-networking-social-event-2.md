The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. 

Our Leeds Social takes place on every first Friday bi-monthly (Feb, April, June, August, October, & December) so why not join us!  Starting from 5pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite to eat or even just a chat with likeminded colleagues

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch!  If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag!

Yorkshire and Humber also have a Google Groups, this is a more informal way for your local organisers to keep in touch. For more information on Google Groups and how to join, check out the '[Groups](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/groups/)' page.
