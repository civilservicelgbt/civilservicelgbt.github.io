The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

In December, we are hosting a festive social which is open to all civil servants in Northern Ireland. Why not wear your favourite Xmas jumper or outfit and get in the festive spirit.

If you would like more information, please reach out to one of the local organisers via email.
