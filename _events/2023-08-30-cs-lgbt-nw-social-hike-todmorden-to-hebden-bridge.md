Before Laura moves back to the West Midlands, please join her for a walk from Todmorden to Hebden via Stoodley Pike. The link below has the route but we’ll be doing it **in reverse** – it should take around 3 hours for the walk, which is slightly challenging at 6 miles with various types of track, so sensible shoes and long trousers recommended.

P﻿lease see the below message from Laura - 

I will be leaving Manchester Victoria station on the 10:21 train, getting into Todmorden for 10:43. Please bring a picnic/snacks, as should the weather permit we’ll be having a lunch picnic at the top near Stoodley Pike. We’ll then head down into Hebden Bridge, and for anyone interested find a nice pub to celebrate the walk in before getting the train back to Manchester from there. 

If we arrive with time to spare, Hebden Bridge also has a arts/crafts/artisan market on Saturdays too, so perhaps a wander around there on the way to a pub.

If you’d like to come, please drop me a message either via email or on the Manchester WhatsApp chat so I have an idea of numbers.

If the weather looks terrible, I will send out a message via email/WhatsApp the night before – by 9pm.

Hope to see you there! - Laura
