Our friendly and informal group is open to people who care for LGBT+ children or have LGBT+ relatives in their family or close friend’s network. This group is also for anyone who has a LGBT+ partner.

Many of our chats are open discussions lead by our group members but we also have guest speakers on relevant news topics or individual experiences.

Our coffee and chat group aims to offer advice and a caring listening ear to anyone who needs to talk about their experiences and concerns whilst supporting LGBT+ individuals in the in the community.

This is a nonjudgemental group and a safe space to discuss anything that maybe affecting the mental health or wellbeing of your loved ones and also how to care for yourself too.
