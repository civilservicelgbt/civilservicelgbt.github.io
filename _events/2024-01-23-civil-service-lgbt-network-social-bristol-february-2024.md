P﻿lease join like minded Civil Servants at the Phoenix on the second Thursday of the month. T﻿his is now being advertised for the rest of 2023 with the hope of running this successfully into 2024 too. 

B﻿ristol Pride 2023 was a great success for our Networks and this will give us a lovely opportunity to keep in touch and create a safe and inclusive social environment.
