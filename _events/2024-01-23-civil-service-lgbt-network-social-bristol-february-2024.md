P﻿lease join like minded Civil Servants on the second Thursday of the month for our social. Dates are starting to be advertised for 2024. We have changed venues to start the year off, please check where we are hosting this event each month.

B﻿ristol Pride 2023 was a great success for our Networks and this will give us a lovely opportunity to keep in touch and create a safe and inclusive social environment.

R﻿egistration is not mandatory, but if you do have any questions or suggestions please do get in touch with your South West local reps - [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt)
