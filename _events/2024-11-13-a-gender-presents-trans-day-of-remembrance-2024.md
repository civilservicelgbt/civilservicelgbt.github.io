We invite you to join a:gender to observe Transgender Day of Remembrance 2024.

The event will include poems, messages of hope and the reading of the names of those who have been recorded as lost to our community. We politely ask that you mute your microphone throughout to enable our speakers to be heard free of interruptions.

This event is open to all those working within the UK Civil Service and you may pass on to colleagues.
