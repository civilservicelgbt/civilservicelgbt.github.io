**Sat 29th April – [Alderley Edge Walk](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/cheshire-greater-manchester/alderley-edge-and-cheshire-countryside/the-wizards-wander-at-alderley-edge?origin=search)** (leaving from Alderley Edge station)

*As Laura is a keen walker and enjoys this particular loop with a view of Manchester in the distance, if anyone wants to join for a walk with a pause at The Wizard’s Tea Room mid-way through (coffee/cake/sausage & bacon sandwiches/vegan options usually available) and potentially the pub near the station before splitting ways, please come along!*

*If you are interested – please could you let us know either via email/Whatsapp/in person at the socials – just so we can gauge interest/numbers – thanks!*



***Meet: 11am @ Alderley Edge train station** (30 mins or so direct from Manchester city centre & also our ending point)*

***Route: Roughly 2-3 hours** or so, with breaks in between – we can adapt depending on fitness/weather. The trail can be sort of steep & muddy, so shoes with good grip/you don’t mind getting dirty recommended.*

*Stops: The Wizard’s Tea Room for coffee/cake (and toilets in the adjacent car park). Potential for the pub at the end – depending on numbers/requests.*

***Cost: Free** – but for the train fare to/from Alderley Edge (roughly £10 rtn from Man. Piccadilly)*

*(*In the case of rain/bad weather, this will be cancelled – notification will be sent via email/Whatsapp by 10pm the evening of the 27th)*
