The QTIPOC+ Inclusion working group is a working group under the banner of The Civil Service Race Forum and was established to support QTIPOC+ civil servants by raising awareness about their lived experiences to improve inclusion in the workplace. \[QTIPOC+ is shorthand for all individuals who identify as both LGBTQIA+ and as an ethnic minority.]

June is Pride Month in the UK and is dedicated to the celebration and commemoration of LGBTIQ+ culture, the uplifting of LGBTIQ+ voices and the support of LGBTQI+ rights. Pride is celebrated in June to mark the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, a series of protests that occurred in New York City after police attempted to raid the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar, on 28 June 1969.

This discussion event will feature Naseef Huda who is the G6 Head of Analysis (HS2 Delivery) at the Department for Transport (DfT) who will be speaking about his career in the Civil Service and his passion for all things related to equality, diversity and inclusion. Naseef is an experienced analyst and former primary school teacher who has had a long and varied career in the Civil Service (and beyond!). T

This is the first in a series of panel discussions with senior colleagues of colour across the Civil Service, who will share the challenges and opportunities they have experienced and how they used both to push boundaries.

The event will give colleagues the opportunity to:

* ask questions and seek advice on career progression tips
* explore building their own individual brand
* understand how to enhance their learning and development.
