Our London Women’s Inclusion team invite you to join them at the V&A LGBTQIA+ tour in October, followed by a visit to a local café or bar to chat. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 15:45 at the tour meeting point in the V&A – Cromwell Road foyer. The tour starts at 16:00 and lasts an hour. Following the tour, we will head to a local café or bar (subject to the group’s preferences) to continue our conversations. 

There is no need to book to go on the tour and further details about it can be found on the V&A website here: [https://www.vam.ac.uk/event/KvAZLb0KK7e/lgbtqia-tour-2023](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vam.ac.uk%2Fevent%2FKvAZLb0KK7e%2Flgbtqia-tour-2023&data=05%7C01%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7Cba2a1aa2d319404966d508dba88d15b9%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638289096121234979%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=MQ92YICUZeQDgvxZnavOgBmjEz2Y256qSkcbYjcz3CA%3D&reserved=0) .
