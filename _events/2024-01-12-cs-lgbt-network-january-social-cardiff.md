The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Welsh Government LGBTI+ Network, PRISM. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on Thursday 25 January for our New Year social?

In the interests of those taking part in Dry January, we will be meeting at Mrs Potts’ Chocolate House from 17:00 onwards. The venue is wheelchair accessible (except for the bathroom, which is down a flight of stairs) and serves a range of hot and cold soft drinks plus cakes and other desserts. Vegan, gluten-free and non-dairy options are all available.

If there’s interest from attendees, we will then move on to Mary’s bar (opposite the venue) from around 19:30 onwards.
