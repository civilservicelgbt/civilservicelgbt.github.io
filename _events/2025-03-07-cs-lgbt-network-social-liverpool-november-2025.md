The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of regular and ad-hoc events throughout the year.

Our Liverpool Socials happen on the first Thursday of every month starting from 5pm until late, so why not join us for a drink, bite to eat or even just a chat? The group meets initially in the Library area which is just to the left of the bar, near the kitchen hatch at Tempest on Tithebarn Street. The group then start moving on to a different venue around 18:30.

Registration is not mandatory, although if you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt) who would be happy to chat and answer any questions you have.
