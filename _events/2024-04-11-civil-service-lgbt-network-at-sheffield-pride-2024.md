The CS LGBT+ Network are running a number of events for pride this year, all events can be found at [here](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/pride-2024/). You can sign up to this and all other events by the form above.

If you have any direct questions about this event please email [yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

We’ll be communicating on the day via a Whatsapp group. To be added to the group, please email [yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

Further details may be available about the actual pride event here – [Kelham Pride](https://www.kelhampride.com/).

We’ll be gathering at the Gardener’s Rest in Kelham beforehand.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
