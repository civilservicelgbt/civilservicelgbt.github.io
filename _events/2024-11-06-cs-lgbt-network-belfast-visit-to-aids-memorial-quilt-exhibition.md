The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

On the 1st December we mark World Aids day 2024. As part of this commemoration the Rainbow Project in Belfast have organised for the Aids memorial quilt to visit Belfast. Â On the day we will meet outside the MAC, before going to view the quilt, learn more about the support available in NI and the work of the Rainbow project.

This is a ticketed event, by registering above we will organise one for each person.

If you would like more information, please reach out to one of the local organisers via email.
