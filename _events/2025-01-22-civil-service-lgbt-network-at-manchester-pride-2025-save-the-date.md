***T﻿his page has been updated on 05 August 2025.***

This is an initial communication to give you some key details and advice in terms of the days plan, unfortunately we are still waiting on Manchester Pride to confirm our parade position and meeting time but this will be shared as soon as we have it – for guidance, last year we met at Castlefield Bowl from 10:30am with an 11am deadline.

***General Plan for the Day:***

Manchester Pride haven’t told us our arrival time yet; but again, for guidance, last year we met at Castlefield Bowl from 10:30am with an 11am deadline so for now we will go with that! Local Organisers will be there half an hour earlier too so if you are early brilliant just come and find us! If you are going to be late, please inform us ASAP, this can be done by posting in the Manchester WhatsApp group or contacting Scott directly.

Upon arriving there will be a system to follow to streamline as much as possible, Scott oversees wristbands – if you have already secured a place head to Scott first to be signed off and get your Parade wristband. If you are a guest of someone parading that has not already had their place confirmed or are turning up on the day and hoping to join us, you will need to be checked against the wait list first. Only when you have your wristband can you collect your t-shirt if you are collecting on the day, t-shirts on the day will be managed by other local organisers but no wristband will mean no tee.

When we know our position number this will be shared in the Manchester WhatsApp group, you need to know this for when we move into the holding zone and formation. When we are moving there from Castlefield Bowl, we will keep the group updated. Following the parade, we will take our usual group photo on the lawn area at the end before heading to The Refuge, Oxford St, Manchester, M60 7HA. This is the bar part of the Kimpton Clocktower Hotel with a courtyard and allows for some time outside the village if anyone would like to join us.

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning to attend Pride celebrations at this location. 

Registration is open and this is done by one form per event.

I﻿f you realise you can no longer attend this event then please do get in touch with your [local organiser](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team/). All of our people are volunteers, please be patient if you do not get a response straight away. 

F﻿or any other queries in relation to the Civil Service LGBT+ Network Pride 2025 activities please email the pride co-ordinator - [pride2025@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2025@civilservice.lgbt).

I﻿t is important to remember that at Pride events were are representing the Civil Service and must act in accordance with our rules and code.
