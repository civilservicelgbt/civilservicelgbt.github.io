The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a regular social event each month at Tempest on Tithebarn Street. You can find more about this on the Events page.

For women who would feel more comfortable meeting together before joining the wider group, we have arranged a Women’s pre meet in a nearby venue for those who would feel more comfortable to join the event in this way. 

You will be able to find the group via a small inflatable unicorn on the table at the venue from 5pm.

From around 6pm, the group will look to head over to join the rest of the group in a nearby venue.
