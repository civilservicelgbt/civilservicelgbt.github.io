Feel like you've been on a non-stop party since midnight on the 1 June? Need a night off from shots and stilettos? Then join us for a sober, relaxed payday social on Monday 30 June! (Sober in the sense of alcohol-free, not in the sense that any of us will stop making bad jokes...)

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town), as well as wider public sector colleagues. Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends!

Mrs Potts’ Chocolate House is wheelchair accessible (except for the bathroom, which is down a flight of stairs) and serves a range of hot and cold soft drinks plus cakes and other desserts. Vegan, gluten-free and non-dairy options are all available.

(For those who enjoy the pub, regular service will resume in July.)
