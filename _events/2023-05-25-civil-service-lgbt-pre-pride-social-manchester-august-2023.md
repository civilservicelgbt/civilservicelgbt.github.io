J﻿oin us for our second summertime social. Hopefully this will be a sunny Saturday afternoon. 

T﻿his social is open to anyone, regardless of whether you are joining us in the parade at Manchester pride. 

I﻿f you are joining us at Manchester pride, this would be a great opportunity to collect your CS LGBT+ Network t-shirt. Collecting this ahead of the parade is a great help to the local organisers and one less thing for them to worry about on the day. - Watch out for an email from the local organisers asking people to confirm this with attendees. 

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
