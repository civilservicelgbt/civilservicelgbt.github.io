The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Our monthly West Midlands socials happen every first Thursday of the month, so why not join us! In April we are organising a fun virtual game night where you can compete in fun games while getting to know new people and catch up with old friends. Please register for this event in order to get the Teams link.

If you are new to the network, have any questions or an idea for a future event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)

For all the latest updates from the West Midlands region, check the West Midlands [topic page](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/topic/west-midlands). We also have a WhatsApp group where we share information and reminders of upcoming events. Please get in touch if you wish to join.
