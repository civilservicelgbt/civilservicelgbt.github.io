Join us for our first CS LGBT+ Coffee Social in Leeds, at Flamingo’s Café.

Starting from 12.30pm and 2pm, stop by for a hot drink, bite or even just a chat.  This is great opportunity to meet colleagues, from across the Civil Service, in a relaxed environment.   It’s a drop-in event so whether you can stay for an hour or just 10 minutes, it would be great to see you. 

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email:  [Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch!  If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots in Flamingo’s Café!
