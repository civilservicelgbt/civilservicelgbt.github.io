Dionysus, the god of wine, has returned in secret to his birthplace of Thebes. Though fathered by Zeus and born of a mortal woman, the city scorns him – denying his mother’s tale and slandering her as a liar. Outraged, Dionysus declares he shall teach the Thebans reverence.

As goes the 405 BC original, widely considered to be Euripides’ greatest tragedy. This bold new reimagining is directed by Indhu Rubasingham in her first show as Director of The National Theatre, infused with anarchic energy and fuelled by spoken word and rhyme.

We’re going along to see this play on Friday the 19th of September at the 19:30 screening – *[you can buy tickets here.](https://tickets.nationaltheatre.org.uk/93813/93844?queueittoken=e_tnew247v5~q_9ede9d21-b885-4ae5-ad1c-66e46069e649~ts_1758096790~ce_true~rt_safetynet~h_e635f4c6793f661d70c65e1c975ab0a14e58485c8fe51ca30f217ab0b8217766)* You will need to purchase your own ticket (at time of writing, the cheap seats in the stalls are only £20!).

An hour before the show begins, we will be meeting at *[The Understudy](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/your-visit/eat-and-drink/the-understudy/)*, the National Theatre bar that’s open to the Southbank. We can also grab a drink afterwards to debrief!

Nearest tube stations are Waterloo, and across the Thames, Embankment and Temple – it is a short walk across Westminster bridge and along the river if you are based in Whitehall.
