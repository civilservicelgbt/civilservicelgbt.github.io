The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year.

Our Leeds Social takes place on every first Friday bi-monthly (Feb, April, June, August, October, & December) so why not join us!  Join us at Curry and Social for some tasty and authentic Indian food, some drinks, and an opportunity to network with colleagues and friends from across Leeds.  

**Please Note:**   To help us reduce the number of ‘no-shows’ and the risk of being charged by the venue for empty seats, a non-refundable deposit of £5 will be requested to secure your place.    In the event of a no-show, this money will be added to our charitable donations pot, which will be given to a local lgbt+ charity at the end of a year (following a ballot of our members).  Details of how to pay your deposit and secure you place at this event will be communicated via email from our local organising team upon registration.

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration for this event is mandatory and closes on 3 June 2024  - register now to avoid disappointment!
