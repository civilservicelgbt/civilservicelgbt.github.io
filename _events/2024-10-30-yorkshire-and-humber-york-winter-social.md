Join us for a CS LGBT+ Winter Social, in York, for an opportunity to meet other LGBT+ Civil Servants in the City.   We’re keen to develop our socials within York, so whether you can join us for an hour or for several we’ll be pleased to see you.  Look out for our Rainbow Unicorn mascot and CS LGBT+ Flag - come say hello, hear about the network, and meet colleagues from across the city.
