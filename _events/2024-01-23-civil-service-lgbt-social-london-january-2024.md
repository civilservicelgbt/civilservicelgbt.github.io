The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

Our London socials usually take place on the **first Thursday of each month**.

We usually organise our London events in Westminster at the Retro Bar. The venue may change especially over summer months, where it is likely to be outdoor at the St James’s Park (weather permitting). **Please check back on this website a few days before the event to find out the exact venue.**

Retro Bar provides us their private venue upstairs and an area downstairs for mobility accessibility and is the preferred venue for most members. Five Guys up the road have disable facilities which our members are welcome to use. 

**If you have any mobility or accessibility queries, please contact your London team ([London@civilservice.lgbt](London@civilservice.lgbt)) in advance, so that they can make the necessary arrangement for you.**

Our London events are incredibly popular – we regularly see around 50 to 100 people attend. Finding venues that are available and as inclusive as possible at no cost to accommodate everyone's needs and tastes is incredibly difficult.

If you have any questions, an idea for a venue, or you're willing to help organise a social yourself, please contact our [London local organisers](/team).
