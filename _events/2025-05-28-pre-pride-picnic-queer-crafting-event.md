Ahead of this year's Pride, come and meet your colleagues from across the civil services and wider public sector for an informal arts-and-crafting session in Cardiff Bay! It's a chance to work on your costume for Pride, or just any of your ongoing craft project.

Tea/coffee and biscuits will be provided - so please let us know if you have any dietary requirements. Please bring your own crafting materials for the event.

The venue is wheelchair accessible and free parking is available on site; otherwise the venue is a 20-minute bus journey from Cardiff city centre. **Please email the event organiser to receive exact location details.**

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if youâ€™re in town), as is anyone who works in the wider public sector. Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends!
