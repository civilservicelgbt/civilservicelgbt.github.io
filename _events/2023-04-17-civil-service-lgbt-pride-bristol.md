B﻿EIS and The Planning Inspectorate (PINS) are sponsoring the CS Network pride entry in Bristol.

Katharine, David & PINS will meet our walking group in Castle park, Bristol close to the bandstand. We will aim to meet close to the what.3.words location of “steer.cheer.being” on 08/07/2023 from 10am for the Pride Parade.

Following the parade, you are free to enjoy Pride Day as you wish! You’ll likely meet people en route who you can enjoy the day with, or spend it with your friends and family. As well as the parade PINS will have a stall at Pride too, go say and hi to the PINS Rainbow Network volunteers.

Pride Day will take place on The Downs, with shuttle busses taking people from the parade finish to the festival location. You may wish to purchase a wristband for the day which is gain you free bus travel - https://bristolpride.co.uk/wristbands/

We will wear our Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirts and everything rainbow you can get your hands on! Please remember to have a change of top to change into after the parade.
