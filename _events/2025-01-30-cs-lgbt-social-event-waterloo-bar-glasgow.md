The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year, so why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants in Glasgow on Wednesday 19th February for a drink, bite or even just a chat.

If you are making your own way to the venue or turning up on the day, we are aiming to be there for 4:00pm – look out for the table with the Rainbow Unicorn. Everyone is welcome.

Registration is not mandatory, but signing up will enable us to keep you informed of any updates.

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, please reach out to the Scotland Local Organisers via email [scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:scotland@civilservice.lgbt)
