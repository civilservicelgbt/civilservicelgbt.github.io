Meet outside Baker Street Kitchen between 1200 and 1300 hours, then we will be heading to Baker and Bedford Street Opposite the Teesside Magistrates courts.


An ever-popular artisan street food and entertainment event with a daytime programme of family-friendly performances, events and activities to celebrate Tees Valley's LGBTQ+ community, with stalls, live music, tasty treats, gorgeous gifts and more. 


It is not believed that there will be a parade/march, but if there is then details will be posted.


In the unlikely event the market is cancelled, it is still intended to go ahead with a social in the Baker Street kitchen.


There is an after pride Blackpool take over party at Sapphires Middlesbrough, and should you wish to attend tickets may be booked at:
