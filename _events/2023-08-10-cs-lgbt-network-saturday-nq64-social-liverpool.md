T﻿his is the first Saturday Social the CS LGBT+ Network are hosting in Liverpool. We will be trying some different types of socials that aren't just being in a bar. I﻿f you have any other ideas of socials you might like to see please drop the team a message. 

R﻿egistration for this event is not mandatory, but if you have any questions you can email the team at [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt)

W﻿e hope that people enjoy this kind of social and want to come along for some classic arcading in November. After some time at NQ64 we will see what the group feel like doing and potentially will move on. Plans from 1500 may be a little fluid so if you do not think that you will be there early please register so that we have some details for you. 

M﻿ore details for NQ64 can be found on their website - [NQ64 Liverpool](https://nq64.co.uk/liverpool/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=Yext&utm_campaign=2823490776887111421)
