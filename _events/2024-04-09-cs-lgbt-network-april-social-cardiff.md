On Friday 12 April, join your fellow LGBTQ+ civil servants at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay for a night at a Doctor Who-themed drag cabaret. There’ll be dimension-defying drag, stratospheric stand-up, burlesque to make a Cyberman blush, and an oncoming storm of surprises!

Seating is unreserved and is very likely to sell out (the Saturday performance is already fully booked!), so **please [buy your own ticket ahead of time](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmc.org.uk%2Fen%2Fwhats-on%2F2024%2Fgallifrey-cabaret&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7Cbbe979903db748152b0508dc57ff8b1e%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638482002268344623%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NI%2BCfX3oX84SAbwH68glfQhyu%2Fk6NS3fx7EFlmH%2FxOA%3D&reserved=0)**. We’ll be meeting at the Cabaret entrance of the WMC from 19:30 (an hour before the show starts) to make sure we can all sit together.

You are welcome to bring supportive friends, partners and family, but please bear in mind that the show is rated for attendees aged 18+. If you’re coming, please email [Bethan.Cable@gov.wales](mailto:Bethan.Cable@gov.wales) so that we can save you a seat if necessary!

The building is fully accessible. If you have a Hynt card you should be able to access a free second ticket for a companion, carer or personal assistant – please [see the website](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmc.org.uk%2Fen%2Fyour-visit%2Faccess%2Faccess-scheme&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7Cbbe979903db748152b0508dc57ff8b1e%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638482002268354783%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=yC661g9Z16nq3kiurZvbQIc%2BggsEyFTfoO%2F5KhERZgk%3D&reserved=0) for more information.
