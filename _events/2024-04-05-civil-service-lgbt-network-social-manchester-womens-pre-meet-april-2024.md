We have listened to feedback from our members and are hoping this new pre-meet will be well received.

Below is a message from our Women’s Inclusion Vice Chair.

I’m sure you’ll have noticed that a lot of our Manchester socials, while really enjoyable, tend to be very male dominated. This can feel slightly intimidating (at least for me!) I want to make sure all civil servants, LGBT+ or allies, feel they can get involved with these monthly socials. I’m therefore setting up these pre-meets for women, before we join the larger social. Please note that this pre-meet is open to anyone who identifies as a woman, or feels like this space would be suitable for them.

If you’d like to meet more women to connect and network with, please join me at 5pm in Velvet on Canal St. We can have a drink and a chat then head over to Via, our normal social venue, at around 6pm where we can meet up with other colleagues. There is no pressure to drink alcohol, as Velvet has a good selection of alcohol-free options. You also don’t have to go to the larger social. If you’d rather not attend the large social and just come to the women’s pre-meet, that is absolutely fine too!

If you have any questions or want a chat about the event, drop me a message on anna.josie@civilservice.lgbt
