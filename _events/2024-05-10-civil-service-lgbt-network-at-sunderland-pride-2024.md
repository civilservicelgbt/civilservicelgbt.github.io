The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

T﻿he organising team will be at The Cooper Rose from 1030 getting some food, and then at the official muster point outside The Port of Call from 1130 in preparation for the parade. 

T﻿he parade begins in the city centre and is easily accessible by car, bus, train or metro. There are no wristbands for the parade and ID is not needed to parade, but you may require this later in the day. 

F﻿or any localised communications for the day, please get in touch with Phil - [philip.hopkins@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:philip.hopkins@hmrc.gov.uk).

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code. If you can no longer attend please email [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt)
