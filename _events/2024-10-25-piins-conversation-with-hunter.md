Join the Rainbow Network as we speak with Hunter and their colleagues who run a small independent queer bookshop and event space in the town of Folkestone. Theyâ€™ll be telling us about their experiences running a space for the LGBTQ+ community within a smaller town/place, and there will be an opportunity for you to pick their brains with a Q&A!

Please contact Jeanie Russell or Sarah Burgess for the meeting link and any other details.
