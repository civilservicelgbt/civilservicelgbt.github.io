The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

This is a joint CS LGBT+ Network and NI Civil service LGBT+ network event. Expect snacks, great company and plenty of seasonal cheer!

We will have 2 crafts available;

* Xmas tree decoration. 
* Xmas suncatchers decoration.

We will have facilitators available to help us out.Â 

This is a limited event, please register by emailing the above link with your name, dept and chosen craft.
