A chance to meet with colleagues across the East Midlands, meeting at the historically LGBT Pub The Lord Roberts. Typically held on the first Friday of the month.

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

Come along to meet like minded civil servants at the East Midlands monthly social.
