The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year.

Our Leeds Social takes place on every first Friday bi-monthly (Feb, April, June, August, October, & December) so why not join us!  Starting from 5pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite to eat or even just a chat with likeminded colleagues

Join us at this pre-social event for a drink and chat, before heading off to our [Curry and Social Event](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/event/2024-05-28-cs-lgbt-leeds-curry-and-social/) (please note that registration for the Curry and Social is mandatory due to booking requirements at the venue)

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration for this pre social is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch!  If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag!
