As the sun comes out and the weather gets warmer, the London organisers are running picnics on the third Thursday of the month! There is no need to register for this event – you can just turn up.

Our picnic is in [Victoria Tower Gardens](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.royalparks.org.uk%2Fvisit%2Fparks%2Fvictoria-tower-gardens&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C186b9e88638a43069f8908dc5fd1bb32%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638490602141114952%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NkynMe7Ei%2FTS6%2FhbqA4kKhnf3r2xwohSnLwQXNJ3GZc%3D&reserved=0), right next to the Houses of Parliament (Abingdon St, Millbank, London SW1P 3JA). We will be sat near to the [Buxton Memorial Fountain](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBuxton_Memorial_Fountain&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C186b9e88638a43069f8908dc5fd1bb32%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638490602141125356%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C60000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GC%2Bm7VzvmksOO93ZjoDMUbQ5h1iYigMXZDZZE5%2FhSL4%3D&reserved=0) and you will be able to spot us there from 17:30 – 20:00 – keep your eye peeled for a Civil Service Pride flag! There is no need to register for this event.

There is a Tesco Metro about a 6 minute walk away, around the back of DEFRA (2 Monck St, London SW1P 2BW) if you would like to pick up snacks or drinks for this picnic. Accessible toilets are available at the Marquis of Granby a 3 minute walk away.

In the event of bad weather, we will instead be heading to the aforementioned Marquis of Granby, just off Smith Square (41 Romney St, Greater, London SW1P 3RF). If you don’t spot us in the park, that is where we will be! To keep informed of the decisions we’ve made about the weather, it may be helpful to join the CS LGBT+ London WhatsApp Group; please email [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt) for more information.
