We’re going to have a sing-song in The Brunel (7 Leicester Place, The Brunel, 47 Swan Rd, Rotherhithe, London SE16 4JN). There is no need to register for this event.

The Brunel is a gay owned pub in Rotherhithe that hosts a drag karaoke evening on Thursdays – the night is very popular in the local community and with people travelling from further away! We know that not all colleagues based in London are able to travel to Central London for events, as many London Civil Servants are not based on the Whitehall campus, so we are trialling a South-East location for a social. Rotherhithe is particularly close to the 10 South Colonnade Government hub.

The pub itself is a one minute walk from Rotherhithe Overground Station (situated on the East London line, between Canada Water and Surrey Quays) or alternatively a six minute walk from Canada Water Underground Station (situated on the Jubilee Line between Bermondsey and Canary Wharf). Warm up your pipes and request a song! Singing is not mandatory but strongly encouraged, and there is YouTube integration so that you may pick a tune that’s less well known. There is also a fully heated garden if you wish to spend some time with colleagues away from the noise!
