We’re going to the King’s Arms on Tooley Street (251 Tooley St, London SE1 2JX) on Thursday 20th March. It’s a 10 minute walk from London Bridge Station – easily accessible to colleagues in Stratford, Canary Wharf and Westminster via a trip down the Jubilee line! This is a fun opportunity to meet other Civil Servants over board games, or just a drink if you prefer.

The King’s Arms has a range of board games available to play and offers food and drinks. We will endeavour to get there slightly early and nab a table (reservations cost £50+) – in order to find us inside, look for the colleague wearing a red hat and red shirt, although we would recommend joining our WhatsApp group to stay informed of where we are on the day (please email [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt) for more information).

Accessibility: Regrettably The King’s Arms is not a fully accessible venue, as it is a Victorian pub. There is a step up to enter, and although access to the women’s toilets is step free, access to the gents is via another couple of steps.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [London Organisers](mailto:%20london@civilservice.lgbt).
