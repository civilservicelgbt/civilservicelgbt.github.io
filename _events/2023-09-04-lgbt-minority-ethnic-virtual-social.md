H﻿i all, 

W﻿e hope everyone has had a lovely summer.

Please join us for our next virtual social on **Thursday 28th September 5-6pm** on MS Teams. 

There’s no strict agenda, it’s an opportunity to grab your bevvy of choice and for us all to get to know another in an informal setting.

W﻿e will be hosting regular monthly online socials on the last Thursday of every month!

If you know other Civil Servants that would love to join us, feel free to share the link to this page, and we’ll see you there!

W﻿e hope to see you there,\
S﻿teve & Claire
