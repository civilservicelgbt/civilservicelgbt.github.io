On Saturday 31 August, we will be attending the Queer Emporium on St Mary Street, Cardiff for their new talent-show style competition to find Wales’s next Butchest Butch! Please [buy your ticket ahead of time](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fqueeremporium.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fbwtch-1&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C6ead66d1c4484a151fcb08dcac0d8b2f%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638574421379426662%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=oOucafsPVcDGLw9%2BxQO%2FnkdXUObNGMXY0Ne%2FYCY0RC8%3D&reserved=0), and let us know if you will be joining us by emailing [Bethan.Cable@gov.wales](mailto:Bethan.Cable@gov.wales) so we can keep you a seat with us. Everyone is welcome to attend – you don’t need to identify as butch yourself.

The Queer Emporium is a fully accessible venue, serving both soft drinks (hot and cold) and alcohol.

Please note that this event is aimed at an adult audience.

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town). Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends.
