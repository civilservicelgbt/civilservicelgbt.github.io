The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

P﻿lease note the change in meeting times, these are slightly earlier than previously noted due to parade positioning. 

Please note there have been changes to the march this year which will be setting off from Festival Park at 12:00, with speeches due to start at 11:30. We need to be in the form up area by 1100

Due to this we will have 2 meeting spots. We will meet outside St Enoch Subway station at 10:00 for those travelling via city centre, we will then take the subway to Cessnock and meet outside the exit to Cessnock station from 10:30 – 10:50 before making our way into Festival Park for 11:00.  

Please note Cessnock subway station is not wheelchair accessible, anyone who this may affect please get in touch with organisers to arrange alternative arrangements. 

Please remember to have a change of top for post parade if you are planning to socialise and drink. We should only be wearing our CS t-shirt for the march/parade only. \
 \
Please ensure you wear comfy clothes including shoes given the distance you will be walking. Although it’s the middle of July, please remember this is Scotland and our summer weather isn’t guaranteed, please plan your outfits accordingly.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
