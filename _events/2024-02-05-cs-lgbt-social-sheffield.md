Join us for our first CS LGBT+ Social in Sheffield, at one of Sheffield’s best pubs, the Rutland Arms!

 

We’ll meet from 1730 and be there until at least 2000. Stop by for a drink, food or even just a chat. This is great opportunity to meet colleagues from across the Civil Service in a relaxed environment. It’s a drop-in event so whether you can stay for an hour or just 10 minutes, it would be great to see you. You’ll be able to find us by looking out for the table with the inflatable unicorn!

 

If you’d like to join the WhatsApp chat in case we need to send any messages on the day please get in touch with your local reps at [yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)
