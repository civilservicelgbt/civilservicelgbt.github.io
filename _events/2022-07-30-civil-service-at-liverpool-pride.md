The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Service's presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

Find out more on our [Pride 2022 topic page](/pride-2022).

## Joining instructions

### Meeting point

Our local organisers, [Matt and Ross](/team), will be on the steps outside Lime Street Train station from 10:00. We will move to the official muster point, St Georges Plateau at 10:30. 

Feel free to join us before moving onto the plateau, if you are not in town early enough. The Civil Service group are in Block 9; look for us there.

You need to be at the muster point no later than 11:00.

### After the parade

After the parade we would love to hold people together to take a large group photo. We will inform people of where on the day.

After the parade and photo, you are free to enjoy your time at Liverpool pride as you please. Matt and Ross will happily share details of their plans, but they will not be offended if people just want to do their own thing.

### T-shirts

If you registered in advance, t-shirts will be provided at the meeting  point. 

Wear comfortable clothes including shoes, as it can be long day.

### Rules of the day

Please remember that we are marching under the CS LGBT+ Network Banner, so again, please respect the CS code of conduct. – Whilst you may wish to attend wearing your CS T-shirt please consider whether you will need a change of top for post parade. 

You must not consume alcohol at the meeting point or on the parade route. LCR Pride have advised participants that these are not licensed for consumption of alcohol and in many public spaces it may be against local by-laws to do so. Local authorities and Merseyside Police may enforce these laws. 

For security reasons no opened soft drinks are permitted through the festival security gates and no alcoholic drinks are permitted that have not been sold on site by authorised vendors. 

If you have access or medical needs that require you to bring your own refreshments, please email <access@prideinliverpool.co.uk> or make yourself known to a steward at the event info points.

### Wristbands

Wristbands are not required to take part in the march.

### Identification

You do not required any form of work identification to take part in the Civil Service group. You **should not** bring your Civil Service ID with you on the day.

You may need other forms of identification to access venues in the area or to purchase age-restricted items like alcohol.

### Accessibility

LCR Pride are working with local organisations to make the event as accessible as possible. 

The event site is the world famous Pier Head - which is on a totally flat surface. 

Medications are are permitted on the site but you are advised that these should be in their original packaging (with your name on if they are prescribed) to avoid any issues identifying these.

### Contact on the day 


Please get in touch with either Ross or Matt to be added to a CS LGBT+ Liverpool Pride WhatsApp group – there is no obligation to join, but it may be helpful for quick comms on the lead up to the day and on the day itself. Their numbers will be circulated to registered participants.
