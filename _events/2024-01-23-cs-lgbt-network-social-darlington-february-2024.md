Meet up with fellow civil servants for a Valentines Special Mongay night at various venues across the town, look out for Martin and/or an inflatable Unicorn. Timings shown here are just for the first location. 

Starting at the Juniper Tree, 25 Grange road Darlington DL1 5NA, a short walk from the market Square and One Bar, then moving on from there.

The Network are hoping to post regular Socials in Darlington once a month on Monday night to co-incide with the revival of the Mongay nights calendar this year.

Registration for this event is not mandatory but helps the organisers to understand who will be coming. If the registration link is not working please email your local organisers at northeast@civilservice.lgbt
