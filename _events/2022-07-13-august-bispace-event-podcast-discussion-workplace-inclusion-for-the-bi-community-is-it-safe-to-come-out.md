Join the BiSpace team for a discussion of Sophie Hagen and Dr Julia Shaw's podcast "Bi People". We will be discussing episode 4, which tells the story of the experience one of the US's first openly Bi politicians, and why it is difficult for some of us to be visibly out at work.  

Please listen to the podcast in advance:

> **BBC Radio 5 Live - Bad People presents: Bi People, Bi People, Bi People**
>
> Episode 4: Are bisexuals invisible at work?
>
> [Listen to the episode on BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0chw0rb)

We intend to discuss our thoughts about this episode in particular, and the Bi People podcast in general if people have listened to it.  And also to apply the themes to our experiences of coming out - or not - at work.

> **Content warning**
>
> This episode does deal with some sensitive themes including abusive relationships and suicidal feelings.
