The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Service’s presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

Find out more on our Pride 2022 topic page.

## Joining instructions

Thank you for registering for Birmingham Pride which this year will be celebrating its 25th anniversary of being in the city. The theme for this momentous occasion is “25 Years of Pride and Protest”. We hope that you have an amazing pride.

For those who have registered to take part in the parade, then please meet at the meeting point which will be Chamberlain Square for 10:45am.

We will then make our way to the Centenary Square as a group where the Parade starting point will be. From the starting point, the parade will then make its way through the city from 12 noon, before making its way to the Gay Village. After the parade, there will be a Civil Service Social event at The Victoria.

### Accessibility
