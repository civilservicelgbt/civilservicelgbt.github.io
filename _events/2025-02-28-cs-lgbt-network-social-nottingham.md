*We have also arranged for a slightly different â€˜non-drinkingâ€™ social for our Nottingham members in March. As per a brilliant recommendation, we shall be meeting at the Pride Shop, where we can get a hot drink and have a look around, before venturing over to the newly opened Hockley Emporium. This is a fabulous new venue championing local LGBT+ creatives and traders, where you can browse vintage clothes and an art gallery. They also have a cafÃ© and a bar open, which serves some lovely plant-based food. It would be fabulous for us to show up and support our newly opened LGBT+ spaces in Nottingham, as it would be nice to use these spaces for future socials ðŸ˜Š. If you would like to see more â€˜non-drinkingâ€™ socials, then please do come so we can gauge if there is a demand for more of these events in future.*

***For our members in Nottingham:***

***Friday 7th March (from 4pm)***

*OPG Spirit Social - Meet Up @ The Pride Shop 65 Maid Marian Way, Nottingham NG1 6AJ*

As we will be making our way to the **Hockley Emporium** soon after, please let me know if you would like to come and join us so that I can provide you with more information regarding meet up times if you can only make it for a later time. As always, some of us will be going to **The Lord Roberts** afterwards for the rest of the evening if anyone would like to join us for more drinks.
