Join fellow civil servants for a Friday Social in Leeds.  It’s an opportunity to meet LGBT+ civil servants, in a safe space, and network. \
\
We’ll be meeting at a new spot:  Bridge End Social in Leeds, an LGBT+ safe space that caters for non-alcoholics and those who’d like a tipple or two.  

New to our Leeds social?  Look out for our group mascot (the Rainbow Unicorn).  Email [YorkshireandHumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:YorkshireandHumber@civilservice.lgbt) for more info.
