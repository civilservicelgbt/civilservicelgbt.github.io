***Love starts with an L - A Conversation on Lesbian Identity, Love, and Community***

In celebration of Lesbian Visibility Week, we’re excited to host a special conversation with Thema, the East Midlands representative for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network. Thema will share her personal journey of growing up in Jamaica, coming out, and what it means to be a visible lesbian of colour. In this open and honest talk, she’ll reflect on the challenges and triumphs of embracing her identity and the importance of being seen.

Love starts with an L is a chance to hear an inspiring story about love, resilience, and the power of visibility within the LGBT+ community. It’s a conversation about the strength in sharing our experiences, the importance of community, and how we can all support each other in creating a more inclusive world.

This will be an informal interactive interview, so join us for this powerful conversation as we celebrate Lesbian Visibility Day and the importance of sharing our stories and ask any questions you may have!
