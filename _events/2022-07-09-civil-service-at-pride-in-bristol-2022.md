The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Service's presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

## Joining instructions

### **Bristol Pride: Saturday 09th July 2022**

Thank you for registering to take part in Bristol Pride.

For those who have registered and will be taking part in the march, then you must arrive at the initial meeting point at Castle Park at 10:00 near the band stand. Please look for the group of people in pale pink T-Shirts with a bright pink banner. 

The parade will then begin at 10:45. 

The [route plan for the parade](https://bristolpride.co.uk/parade/) can be found on the Bristol Pride website.

The route of the march is step-free and where possible Bristol Pride have tried to reduce the number of hills that we take during the march. It should be noted that if you do have restricted mobility or you are a wheelchair user then you may struggle with the loop around Cabot Circus due to the steep incline up Union Street. This can be minimised by carrying on along Newgate and joining the parade again at the end of Wine Street for the final section towards the Amphitheatre. [For specific questions please contact Bristol Pride](http://bristolpride.co.uk/contact-us/).

At the end of the parade route there will be shuttle busses to The Downs. Please bring ID during the event at The Downs and please remember that if youâ€™re wearing the CS LGBT+ Network T-Shirt then you are representing the Civil Service.

We will separate following the parade so that you can enjoy the day with whomever you choose, however if you are coming alone on the day then you will be able to find friends along the parade route to spend your afternoon and evening with. There is a group which you can also join ahead of the event so please contact [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt) for details.

If you have registered for a t-shirt then these will be available to collect on the day unless otherwise arranged. If you have not registered for a t-shirt then please still come along and wear your best pride outfits.

### Rules of the day

**Please remember that you are representing the Civil Service and that you should adhere to the Civil Service Code at all times, but especially when wearing the Civil Service t-shirts and during the march.**

### Wristbands

Optional [wristbands are available for purchase on the Bristol Pride website](https://bristolpride.co.uk/wristbands/).

### Questions

If you have any further questions then please contact your local representative  [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt).

\*Happy Pride\**
