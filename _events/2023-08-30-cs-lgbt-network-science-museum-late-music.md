Our London Women’s Inclusion team invite you to join them at Science Museum Lates. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 18:00 at the Pret a Manger, 15 Old Brompton Rd. We will be there until 18:45 before we head to the museum to start to explore. At that time you are then free to experience the museums exhibits with us or in small groups. 

The event takes place from 18:30 to 22:00, 19 October at the Science Museum, London. Tickets are free and need to be booked at the Science Museum website here: [https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/science-museum/music-lates](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencemuseum.org.uk%2Fsee-and-do%2Fscience-museum%2Fmusic-lates&data=05%7C01%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C543f79294c8c4ab923d808dba88a7c34%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638289084955426011%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=udzz7g2hFtBKKQs4T6KUoX%2Byio9GwlXECGwdiNP4DVc%3D&reserved=0) .
