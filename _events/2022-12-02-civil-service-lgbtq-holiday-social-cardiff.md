Join other LGBTQ+ civil servants and public sector staff at our last social of 2022 at the Queer Emporium in Cardiff.

The Emporium serves cocktails, mocktails, hot drinks and a limited selection of vegan/vegetarian cold food, and is fully accessible.

We may move on to a secondary venue after 6pm if there's interest, so don't forget to let us know if you're coming late and we'll can keep you updated!
