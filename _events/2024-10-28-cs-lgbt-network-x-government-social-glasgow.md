Coordinated by civil servants across Glasgow, come along to our social!

All civil servants in the region are welcome to attend, and others if you are in town.

We may have local arrangements for folks traveling from respective offices across Glasgow you can find out details by signing up.  If you are making your own way down or turning up on the day, we are aiming to be at the venue for before 18:00, the space will likely say ‘David and Harry.  Do stop by for a hello!

Registration is not mandatory, but signing up will enable us to keep you informed of any updates.

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, please feel free to reach out to the Scotland Local Organisers via email: *[scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:scotland@civilservice.lgbt)*

R﻿egistration is not mandatory, but please feel free to register if you would like to be kept up to date with any information.
