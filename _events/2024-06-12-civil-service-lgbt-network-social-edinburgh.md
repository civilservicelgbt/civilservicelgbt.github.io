Coordinated between X government colleagues across Edinburgh, we were keen to kick start some summer activity in Edinburgh, and off the back end of pride we thought a post work catch-up would be ideal.

We will be meeting in our respective offices at 1730 and then we will travel to the location together. If you want to make your own way down or you are turning up on the day, we are aiming to be at the venue for before 18:00.  Do stop by for a drink and chat!

Registration is not mandatory, but signing up will enable us to keep you informed of any updates.

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, please feel free to reach out to the Scotland Local Organisers via email: [scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:scotland@civilservice.lgbt)
