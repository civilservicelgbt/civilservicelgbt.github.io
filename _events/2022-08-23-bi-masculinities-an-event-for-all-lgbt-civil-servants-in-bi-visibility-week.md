**In collaborative celebration of Bi Visibility Week, the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and the Environment Agency LGBT+ Network would like to invite all LGBT+ civil servants to an informative panel event focussing on “Bi+ Masculinities”.  This is an event for our lesbian, gay, trans, ace and other colleagues and friends on the rainbow, as well as Bi+ colleagues.**

Bi+ men and bi+ masculine non-binary people often experience a heightened level of invisibility and a particular set of false assumptions, compared to bi+ women and bi+ feminine non-binary people.  We have invited an engaging and diverse panel of speakers to share their lived experience, following which there will be opportunity for questions and discussion.

**Originally planned for Bi Visibility Week, this event  has been rearranged to 10 October, and previous people who registered will be emailed in the next couple of days. If you still want to register, please  contact [info@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:info@civilservice.lgbt) by Saturday 8 October, following which a Teams link will be sent.**
