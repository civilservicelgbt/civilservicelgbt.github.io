The Rainbow Network is honoured and delighted to welcome Lord Smith of Finsbury as our speaker for LGBTQ+ History Month. Lord Smith was Britain’s first out gay MP and Secretary of State, and first out HIV+ MP. He was part of and witness to recent LGBTQ+ history as made or influenced by Parliament. 

Since standing down as an MP in 2005, Lord Smith has held a variety of eminent roles alongside being a working Peer. He was Chair of the Environment Agency from 2008-2014, and he now holds Academic Office as Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was vice-President of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality from 2009 until the organisation closed in 2015. We look forward to hearing more about his incredible career and life story.
