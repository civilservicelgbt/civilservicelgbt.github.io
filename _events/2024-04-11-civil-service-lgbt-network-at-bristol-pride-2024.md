Katharine will meet you from 9.45 am at the Bandstand end of Castle Park and the parade will depart at 10.45. Please ensure you have arrived by 10.30 to avoid missing the start. For a precise what.3.words location for our group, please contact [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt) or join the whatsapp group for the day when invited.

The route for parade the 2 miles long and will take about 1 hour to complete.
