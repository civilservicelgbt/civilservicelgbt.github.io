The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Our monthly West Midlands socials happen every first Thursday of the month, so why not join us! We usually start around 6pm and all civil servants are welcome to stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory but encouraged. When you arrive at the Loft, look out for 'Liz' our inflatable unicorn mascot.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact the West Midlands local organisers.

For all the latest updates from the West Midlands region, check the West Midlands topic page. We also have a WhatsApp group where we share information and reminders of upcoming events. Please get in touch if you wish to join.
