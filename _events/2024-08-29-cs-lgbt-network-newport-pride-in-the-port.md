Newport’s third ever Pride festival is taking place on Saturday 7 September! There will be a march through the city centre starting at Friar’s Walk at midday, followed by entertainment on High Street and Bridge Street stages as well as market stalls on the High Street and Griffin Street and a children’s arts and crafts zone at The Place.

While the CS LGBT+ Network won’t be attending in an official capacity, a few of us from [the regular monthly socials](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.civilservice.lgbt%2Fevent%2F2024-07-25-cs-lgbt-network-august-social-cardiff%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7Cd3edddfee232447d7fc208dcc7efd3e7%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638605080142705277%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Ikotcot1lFqbKzUvuSOEBoMNdbrnPVsBL4KoKpdEzeA%3D&reserved=0) are planning to go – if you would like to come too, let me know at [Bethan.Cable@gov.wales](mailto:Bethan.Cable@gov.wales) and I’ll put you in touch with everyone.
