The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year.

Owing to the current suspension of Mongay night due to the demise of Hoskins bar it has been decided to temporarily switch to Thursday until further details are known.  This event is being held in partnership with the Darlington Economic Campus Departmental Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on the Thursgay Summer Social. 

The Juniper Tree, 25 Grange Road Darlington DL1 5NA, a short walk from the Market Square and One Bar, if arriving at Darlington station walk down the hill and keep going until you reach the town and the Market Square in the centre.

Should attendees wish we can move on to different venues or the event can end when people want to go home.
