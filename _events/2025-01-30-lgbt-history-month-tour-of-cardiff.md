Following on from last year’s walking tour of Cardiff’s queer history, this year we will be avoiding the rain by taking a stroll round [Amgueddfa Cymru/the National Museum of Wales](https://museum.wales/) to see some of their works by LGBTQ+ artists and/or with LGBTQ+ subject matter. We will then walk through Cardiff to Wales’s oldest queer venue, the Golden Cross Pub!

To join the tour, please meet us outside the Museum at 14:00 on Saturday 8 February. Entry to the museum is free.

The Museum is fully accessible, as is the Golden Cross.
