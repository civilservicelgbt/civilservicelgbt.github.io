The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on Tuesday morning for a refreshing swim and natter over breakfast before the working day.

Registration is not mandatory; however it helps us know who to wait for before going in to the pool as a group. Tickets for swimming can be bought on the door and don’t need to be booked in advance.

Parliament Hill Lido offers a beautiful setting for swimming in an unheated outdoor pool, come rain or shine. There are lifeguards, warm showers, changing rooms and toilets. There is also a café on site open from 8am.

We will all meet outside the ticket entrance from 7:45am and aim to be by the pool by 8am. This should give us all time to have a dip with plenty of time to gather by the poolside after the swim with a hot drink and/or breakfast before we need to get on with our days. Thankfully, there are good transport connections nearby –Overground, Northern Line, and London buses.

There is no need to book a ticket in advance as it is a drop-in session until 9.30am. If anyone is running late, or wants to join a little later in the morning, they are most welcome to join the group inside the lido.

We welcome all levels of experience but expect everybody to be responsible for their own safety and make sure they don’t do more than they are capable of.
