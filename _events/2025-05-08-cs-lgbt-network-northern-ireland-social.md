The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

Come along to meet like-minded civil servants at the Northern Ireland social, while we prepare to celebrate the Belfast Pride festival 2025.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our Northern Ireland team at the below email address.
