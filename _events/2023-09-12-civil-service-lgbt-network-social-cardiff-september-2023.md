Join other LGBTQ+ civil servants and public sector staff at Cardiff’s Queer Emporium. Welsh Government and UK Government staff are all welcome!

The Emporium serves cocktails, mocktails, hot drinks and a limited selection of vegan/vegetarian cold food, and is fully accessible. 

We generally move on to a secondary venue after the Emporium closes if there’s interest, so don’t forget to let us know if you’re coming late and we’ll keep you updated!

Sign up by emailing [Bethan.Cable@gov.wales](<mailto: Bethan.Cable@gov.wales>).
