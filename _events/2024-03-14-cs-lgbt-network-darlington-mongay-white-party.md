The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Darlington Economic Campus Departmental Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on the Mongay White Party Social.  Martin will be there from 1800 due to an appointment but please come earlier after work if you wish.

Starting at the Juniper Tree, 25 Grange Road Darlington DL1 5NA, a short walk from the Market Square and One Bar, if arriving at Darlington station walk down the hill and keep going until you reach the town and the Market Square in the centre.

A White party is a staple in the LGBT+ community, and a time for celebration ushering in pool parties and summer weather.  They were started as fundraisers for HIV/AIDS related charities honouring a strong community and signify a safe place where people can gather and be themselves.

We can’t guarantee sunshine in Darlington and there is always the Dolphin Centre Pool if you fancy a dip, alternately wear something white if you wish (beige, cream or apricot are also acceptable) and look out for Martin and/or his inflatable Unicorn. 

The event timings are just for the meeting point as it is intended to move on to the various venues after this, likely to be the Old Dun Cow/Avalon/Hoskins

Any latecomers should go to either of these venues close to the Juniper Tree and find the group.  The event will end when people want to go home.
