We've had a few requests for a coffee morning, so we're introducing "Caffeinated Civil Servants"! We'll be sipping on lattes in Mikkel Coffee (93 Tottenham Court Road, London W1T 4TW), the cult Greek coffee shop. If you're not much of a coffee drinker, they do a delicious affogato and an incredible Thessaloniki bougatsa! This is a sober social and we'll have some structured ice breaker questions if you're feeling nervous about coming along for the first time. 

Our coffee morning will run 11:00 - 12:00. If you've not met any of us before, keep your eye out for someone in a wooly beret and a beard, as that'll be one of the local organisers. 

Accessibility: Mikkel Coffee has a wheelchair accessible entrance, and we will aim for an easily accessible table. The nearest station is Goodge Street (Northern line - Charing Cross Branch) which has a lift but is not fully step free. The nearest step free stations are Euston Square (westbound only - Circle, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan lines) and King's Cross St. Pancras (Circle, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan, Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines). There is also step free access from the Elizabeth Line at Tottenham Court Road station.
