You are cordially invited to join us for our virtual social in March 2024

This is part of the regular series of virtual socials for Civil Service staff who identify both as LGBT+ and an ethnic minority to meet others like themselves, and to provide opportunities to network.

There’s no strict agenda, it’s an opportunity to grab your bevvy of choice and for us all to get to know another in an informal setting.

Register now to secure your spot.
