Tï»¿he BiSpace team are hosting an event aimed at colleagues from grades AA-HEO, demystifying success profiles in a safe space with a SEO and a G7 who are both bisexual and have both overcome challenges and secured promotions from more junior grades over the years. We believe that "you can't be  what you can't see", and there are fewer out role models in the higher grades. This session aims to unpack the success profiles process, provide opportunity for you to share your own experiences, and work through a fictional case study to illustrate how to put the success profiles approach into practice.
