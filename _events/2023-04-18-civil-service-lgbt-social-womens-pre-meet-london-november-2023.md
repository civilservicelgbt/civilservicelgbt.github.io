Our London Women’s Inclusion team would love to invite you to join them at the new monthly pre-meet before the main London Civil Service LGBT+ Social. This event is open to everyone who identifies as a woman and/or feels like this space would be suitable for them.

We are setting up these pre-meets for our members so we can meet and chat in a quieter environment, before joining the larger social. 

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join Maria, Oriana and Valentina from 6pm at Coffee by Real Eating Co (442 Strand, WC2R 0QU). This is a small coffee shop opposite the Charing Cross rail station. We will have a coffee/tea and a chat before heading over to Retro Bar, our normal social venue, around 7pm to meet up with other colleagues. You don’t have to go to the larger social and you can come just to our pre-meet if you prefer. Alternatively, if you are running late and/or prefer to come directly to Retro Bar, do come to say hello when you see us there!

Please drop us an email if you fancy a chat or have any questions - [maria.ionescu@governmentlegal.gov.uk](maria.ionescu@governmentlegal.gov.uk), [oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk](oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk) and [valentina.shah@hmrc.gov.uk](valentina.shah@hmrc.gov.uk).
