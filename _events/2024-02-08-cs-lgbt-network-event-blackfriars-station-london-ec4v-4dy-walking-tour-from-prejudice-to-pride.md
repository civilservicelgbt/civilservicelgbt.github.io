The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on a walking tour through the Square Mile of London and learn a bit more about some of the LGBT+ History in the City of London.

The City Belonging Project is hosting a limited edition, free guided walk run by City of London Guides in partnership with the City of London Corporation. From their website: “*Uncover some of the LGBT+ history of the Square Mile through the ages. Many will have heard of the Molly Houses but what about the female bagnios; or the Cathedral ‘convenience; gay kings; \[] theatre and what did Henry VIII have to do with it all? Come and explore these and more with an official City of London Guide on one of these five evening tours to mark LGBTQ+ History Month. If you are part of a Pride network at your workplace or elsewhere, this could be a fantastic way to bring your colleagues together to explore the City. We aim to make our tours as accessible as possible but there are some uneven surfaces.”*

This is a ticketed event. You will need to book your place on the tour at their website [https://belongingproject.city/tours/p/pride](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbelongingproject.city%2Ftours%2Fp%2Fpride&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C090da7e0bb6b497266c208dc28905310%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638429847585428797%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qqfwyKF2rRscBgdj532RvvXOJ8Koi5BxAe0sSaneP%2Fo%3D&reserved=0) .  

For accessibility needs, please get in touch at [belonging@cityoflondon.gov.uk](mailto:belonging@cityoflondon.gov.uk) or alternatively, contact us and we can find this out for you.

We will meet by the Petit Pret just inside the main entrance of Blackfriars Station on the north side of the river from 6.10pm. We will then join the tour group at 6:30pm. The tour lasts until 8pm so please wear something warm and comfortable to walk around in outside. After the tour, there may be an option to go somewhere warm nearby to continue networking should the group wish to.

Those who have signed up with us will be sent further details around the tour and contact details for those running late but still want to come along.
