February is LGBT+ History Month and to celebrate, the Crown Commercial Service's Pride in CCS Network are holding a History Month quiz. All are welcome - you don’t need to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community or a member of the network to join us! This year's History Month theme is ‘Behind the Lens’, so get ready to test your knowledge of LGBTQ+ people in cinema, television and beyond. Come along for a bit of fun, to meet some new colleagues, or even to learn something new! 

We are using the quiz to raise money for AKT (the Albert Kennedy Trust), a charity that supports LGBTQ+ young people in the UK who are facing or experiencing homelessness. If you feel able to support us, a £2 donation would be greatly appreciated. You can donate through JustGiving, details will be shared on the call.
