J﻿oin our women's VC Anna on a Saturday hike around Hebden Bridge, West Yorks.

I will get the 09.36 train from Manchester Piccadilly train station which gets into Hebden Bridge at 10.14, but of course you can get there however is best for you.

From there, I'm planning this route:

Y﻿ou can find more info here: [Stoodley Pike hike (nationaltrail.co.uk)](https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/app/uploads/stoodley_pike_hike2.pdf)

Please bring a picnic/snacks, as should the weather permit we’ll be having a lunch picnic. If you’d like to come, please drop me a message either via email or on the Manchester WhatsApp chat so I have an idea of numbers. Make sure to dress suitably, pack lots of water, and have your phone fully charged. I'll head back on the train when we're done and may be tempted by a local pub.

If the weather looks terrible, I will send out a message via email/WhatsApp the night before – by 9pm.

Hope to see you there!
