The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

Our Liverpool socials take place on the **fourth Thursday of each month**.

We usually organise our Liverpool events in Liverpool City Centre. The venue sometimes changes, so check back on this website a few days before the event to find out the exact venue. On the day, you'll be able to identify the rest of the group by an inflatable unicorn totem pole!

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our North West local organiser, [Ross Starkie](/team/ross-starkie/).
