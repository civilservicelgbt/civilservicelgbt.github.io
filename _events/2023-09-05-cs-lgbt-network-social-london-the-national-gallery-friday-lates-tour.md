Our London Women’s Inclusion team invite you to join them at the National Gallery Friday Lates Gallery tour, followed by a visit to a local bar to chat. The tour scheduled to take place is focused on the ‘styles and symbolism of facial hair found throughout art history’ and falls in the month of Movember. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 18:45 at the tour meeting point in The National Gallery – The Central Hall. The tour starts at 19:00 and lasts 45 minutes. Following the tour, we will head to a local bar (subject to the group’s preferences) to continue our conversations. 

There is no need to book to go on the tour, however a free Gallery entry ticket does need to be booked to gain admission to the building. Further details about it can be found on the National Gallery website here: <https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/events/talks-and-conversations-friday-lates-gallery-tour-portrait-of-a-bearded-man-17-11-2023> .

Please note, access to the National Gallery and the tour is also open to all members of the public. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit, they are also welcome to join.  

Please do get in contact with the event host should you have any questions or feedback / running late on the day – [Oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:Oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk).
