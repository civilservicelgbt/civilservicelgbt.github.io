The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. In April, join us for a walk in Malvern Hills and a lunch at a local cafe! We will start at 11am and all civil servants are welcome to join, just bring good shoes, water bottle and weather appropriate clothing. This walk will be hilly but we will adjust the pace to the slowest walker and will not leave anyone behind.

Registration is a must as we will share the exact meeting location and more information with the people who have registered via email. This way we also know to expect you and can inform you of any changes. Please note this event is weather dependant and in case of adverse weather, we may have to postpone the walk. 

If you are keen to join but find it difficult to travel to Great Malvern, please let us know and we will do our best to help arrange carpools from Birmingham.

If you are new to the network, it's your first event, you have questions, or even an idea for a future event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)
