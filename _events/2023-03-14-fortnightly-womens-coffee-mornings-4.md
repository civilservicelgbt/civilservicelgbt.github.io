These fortnightly informal coffee mornings are a chance to meet LGBT+ women cross government and chat to new people. There won’t be an agenda or plan for these sessions. Bring a brew and take some time out of your day to unwind. These sessions are open to anyone who identifies as a woman and feels this would be a safe space for them. 



These events are open to civil servants only. You can attend these events if you are:

• a cisgender or transgender woman, non-binary, femme or questioning, and

• LGBTQ+
