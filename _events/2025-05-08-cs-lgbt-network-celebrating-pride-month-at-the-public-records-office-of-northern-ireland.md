The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

On the 3rd of July 2025 join us as we celebrate Belfast Pride month at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.

During our event we will be looking at the history of Belfast Pride and how it started out. We will get time to view the collections of records held from Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association (NIGRA), PA Mag Lochlainn and Cara-Friend, all while hearing about how we as a community can contribute to preserving our history.

During our visit we will hear about the amazing work the public records office does in NI to conserve the past and hear how they are conserving LGBT+ history in the region.

To hear this history is a great privilege and we hope to share it with as many of you as possible. Numbers are restricted so it will be based on a first come first serve basis. 

The tour will be split into 2 groups, those who wish to view the collection and those who wish to go behind the scenes of PRONI.

Please confirm in your email if you would like to:

\- View collection only

\-﻿ Behind the scenes tour and view the collection

If you would like more information, please reach out to one of the local organisers via email.
