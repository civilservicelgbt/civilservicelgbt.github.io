T﻿he West Midlands Local Organisers are planning a quiz to start the year off. This will be a nice opportunity to meet other Civil Servants and have a bit of fun to beat some of the January blues.

P﻿lease make sure that you register for this event to make sure you are sent the MS Teams link by the local organisers closer to the social day.
