The Rainbow Network is delighted to host a festive event with representatives of the London Gay Men's Chorus. Since 1991, when nine friends decided to sing carols outside Angel tube station to raise money for the Terrence Higgins Trust, the LGMC has grown to become Europe's largest gay choir. We will hear more of their story, and about their performances, charity and outreach work today. And we will hear some music, although the whole choir is unlikely to join us!
