The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why donâ€™t you join fellow Civil Servants on Bi+ Visibility Day.

Join us in celebrating Bi+ Visibility Day. We will explore the history of the Bi+ community, myth-busting and awareness-raising about Bisexual, Pansexual and Asexual experiences, including personal stories. There will be an opportunity for Q&A and sharing your own experiences in a safe space.

The meeting will be held via MS Teams and an invite will be sent out ahead of time. Please register using the registration form by the deadline for this very exciting and informative event.
