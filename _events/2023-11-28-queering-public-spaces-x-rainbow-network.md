The Rainbow Network is delighted to welcome speakers from Arup and the University of Westminster to discuss their research into how we can rethink public spaces to create more inclusive, welcoming and hospitable environments for all members of our communities. Questions being explored include the relationship between queer communities and public spaces, the key characteristics of queer public space and how do we protect what remains of queer memory in our cities?
