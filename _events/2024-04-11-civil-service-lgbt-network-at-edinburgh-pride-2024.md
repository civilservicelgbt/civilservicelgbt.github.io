The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

O﻿n the day please meet Queen Elizabeth House, 1 Sibbald Walk, EH8 8FT at midday. From here the group will make their way to the Scottish Parliament at 1230, where the march will assemble before starting at 1300. A full route map can be found [here](https://www.prideedinburgh.org/the-march/).

T﻿he parade will be completed without a vehicle for the Civil Service LGBT+ Network group. For full accessibility details please contact Edinburgh Pride organisation.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
