The Tate Modern (Bankside, London SE1 9TG - nearest tube station Blackfriars) is current hosting an exhibition on Leigh Bowery - a famous club promotor who was a vibrant presence in London throughout the 1980s and 90s. Known for his outlandish, avant garde and fashion forward outfits and performance art, Leigh was an iconic member of the Club Kids and left an indelible mark on pop culture. This exhibition rare chance to experience many of Bowery’s ‘Looks’ alongside his collaborations with artists including Michael Clark, John Maybury, Baillie Walsh, Fergus Greer, Nick Knight and Lucian Freud.

As Tate Lates don’t include exhibitions, we are going to run our visit on a Saturday. We’ll be meeting at the ground floor café at 13:45, with an aim to attend the exhibition at 14:15. If you’ve not attended one of our socials before, we would recommend joining our WhatsApp group to stay informed on the day (email [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt) for more information). You will need to purchase your own ticket for £18 (non-members) [from this link](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/leigh-bowery). After exploring the exhibition we may visit some of the permanent collection or head elsewhere.
