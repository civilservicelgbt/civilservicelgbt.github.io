Join your fellow civil servants to see the cinema screening of the current West End play, The Motive and the Cue, starring Mark Gatiss, Johnny Flynn and Tuppence Middleton. The play sees iconic Welsh actor Richard Burton, newly married to Elizabeth Taylor, in New York as he rehearses for a production of Hamlet under the direction of the legendary actor Sir John Gielgud. Burton is wracked with doubt about his acting abilities; Taylor is desperately bored and alone in their hotel suite; Gielgud’s career has been on a downward spiral ever since his conviction for a homosexual offence. Together they must somehow find a way to create “a new Hamlet for our time”. For more information about the play, please see the [National Theatre website](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationaltheatre.org.uk%2Fproductions%2Fthe-motive-and-the-cue%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C911ed76ec33348a6f9e608dc3702211f%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638445729490397102%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=TqN9XxQvVDsMoHv6RkdvpDiqTfhXwkLJ7z8xUDTIJGE%3D&reserved=0).
