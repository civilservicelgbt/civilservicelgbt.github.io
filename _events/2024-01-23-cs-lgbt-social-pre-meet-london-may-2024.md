The London LGBT+ team would love to invite you to join them at the pre-meet before the monthly LGBT+ social at Retro Bar. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network. The pre-meet gives a space to those who may feel more comfortable getting to know a smaller group of people before going to the larger social, or for anyone who prefers a café setting over a pub setting for a monthly chat. There is no obligation to go to the larger social and you can come just to our pre-meet if you prefer. Alternatively, if you are running late and/or prefer to come directly to Retro Bar, do come to say hello when you see us there!

At least one of the team will be there from 6pm at Coffee by Real Eating Co (442 Strand, WC2R 0QU). This is a small coffee shop opposite the Charing Cross rail station. We will have a coffee/tea and a chat before heading over to Retro Bar, the larger social venue, at 7pm to meet up with other colleagues. 

As the café is small, there may not always be a table free when we arrive. As such, please send us an email to let us know you intend to join us (by 6pm on the day) so we can move to an alternative venue if needed nearby – [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt)
