The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country. This event has been organised with NI Civil Service LGBT+ network.

On the 27 May, join us as we celebrate the launch of the LGBTQIA window at Belfast city Hall. We will be hosted by the Lord Mayor Micky Murray, before getting to hear the story behind the window.

This will be followed by a tour of Belfast City Hall, by one of their experienced tour guides.

The event is limited, so please sign up asap. If you can no longer make the event, please let the organisers know.

If you would like more information, please reach out to one of the local organisers via email.
