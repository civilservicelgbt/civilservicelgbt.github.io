In an LGBT+ History Month special, the Rainbow Network is delighted to welcome Paul Fairweather to tell his life story. From moving to Manchester in 1978 to work for the Campaign for Homosexual Equality, to becoming the first Gay Man's Officer at Manchester City Council and then becoming an HIV campaigner, Paul has lived and made LGBT+ history over the past 50 years.
