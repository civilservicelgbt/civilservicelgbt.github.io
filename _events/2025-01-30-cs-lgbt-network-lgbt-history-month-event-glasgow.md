The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the HMRC PRISM LGBT+ Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on 19 February for our exciting LGBT+ History Month Event

We will have presentations around LGBT History, alongside some stories, quizzes, and activities.

Spaces will fill up fast, however we will be holding a reserve list. 

We hope to see as many of you at the event as possible. Attendance to EDI events are supported by ExCom and can be included as part of your 5 days of learning per year. 

Please also feel free to join us afterwards from 16:00 at our Social event in the Waterloo Bar, Glasgow, right across the road from 1AS. 

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, please reach out to the Scotland Local Organisers via email [scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:scotland@civilservice.lgbt)
