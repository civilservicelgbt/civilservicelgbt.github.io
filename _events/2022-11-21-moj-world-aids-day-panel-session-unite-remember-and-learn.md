Panel will discuss the 1980’s Aids epidemic, learning it’s history, remembering, and commemorating those who have died from Aids-related illness and uniting in the continued fight against HIV. 

It will include message and personal account from Senior LGBT+ Champion Malcolm Bryant, along with discussing the role that women played, reflecting on the memorial blanket and other artwork, hearing from those working in a HIV charity, personal experiences and opportunity to ask questions.
