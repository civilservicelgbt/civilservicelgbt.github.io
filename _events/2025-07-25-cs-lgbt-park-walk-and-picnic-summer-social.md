Come along for a relaxed afternoon in the park with fellow civil servants in Leeds.  We’ll enjoy a leisurely walk, followed by a picnic with lawn games, great conversation, and a chance to connect with colleagues across departments.

Whether you're new to the area or a long-time local, it's a perfect way to unwind and relax with likemindeds.  Simply bring your lunch, a blanket, and any games you'd like to share. \
