We’re watching LGBT themed films in the Prince Charles Cinema, just by Leicester Square (7 Leicester Place, London WC2H 7BY - edge of Chinatown)

You do not need to register for this event, you can just turn up. However you will need to purchase your own ticket. Tickets sell out fast so please ensure you purchase in advance - there is no guarantee that tickets will be available in the box office.

This month we’re watching Sedmikrásky (1966), a groundbreaking arthouse surrealist comedy film written and directed by Věra Chytilová. Banned from theatres in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic at release, the film follows two teenage girls (both called Marie) as they engage in a variety of disruptive and subversive pranks and indulge in hedonism.

A pre-meet is available at 17:30 in The Long Acre (1 Upper St Martin's Ln, London WC2H 9NY), and we’ll head over to Prince Charles Cinema at 17:50 (with an opportunity to pick up snacks on the way). You can spot the CS LGBT+ rep by their red hat!

The screening starts at 17:45. After the film we’ll be heading round the corner to Ku Bar (30 Lisle St, London WC2H 7BA) for an opportunity to discuss the film.

17:30 - Pre meet – The Long Acre

17:50 - Head to Prince Charles Cinema

18:00 - Film starts

Afterwards - Ku Bar

Accessibility: Regrettably the Prince Charles Cinema is not a fully accessible venue. There is a ramp to get into the foyer, but this film is screened on the upstairs screen - there are 20 steps up and, once you get into the screen, further steps to each row. If you sit in the back row you can avoid any further steps.

There are 20 steps down from the foyer to the bar, where the bathrooms are. From the bar, the men’s is step-free while the women’s has one step and a sharp corner that a wheelchair could not access. Regrettably, there are not single occupancy toilets on the premises.
