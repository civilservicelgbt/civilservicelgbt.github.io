The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Civil Service Live is being held at the Liverpool M&S Bank Arena this year, and so for colleagues visiting from across the country as well as the usual network in Liverpool, we are hosting a social event afterwards if anyone would like to join before they make the journey home.

We will be meeting at the One O’clock Gun bar from 4pm, which is located in the Albert Dock directly next to the M&S Bank Arena.

There will be a rep from the North West network there from 4pm, although please do feel free to arrive before or after this time and we will be there until around 6pm before moving on.
