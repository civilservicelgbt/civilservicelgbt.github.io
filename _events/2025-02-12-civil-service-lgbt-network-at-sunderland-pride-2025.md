Time: Meet from 11.15am, March starts at 12pm

FREE EVENT – everyone is welcome

The Pride in Sunderland March this year takes place on International Stonewall Day and it’s also the 55thanniversary since the first Pride march took place in New York following the Stonewall Riots We’ll have music and entertainment, and we want you to dress to impress, bring banners, whistles and let’s make some noise. Pride marches are about protest as well as celebrating identity and community, and in these difficult times, we want the voices of LGBTQ+ people and our amazing allies to be heard.  Tell your friends, bring your family and let’s get as many people as possible to join us and celebrate our civic pride in Sunderland. It’s an easy and accessible march from Park Lane to our Pride in the City arena at Keel Square.

Celebrate your Pride as we march out, loud and proud through Sunderland City Centre.
