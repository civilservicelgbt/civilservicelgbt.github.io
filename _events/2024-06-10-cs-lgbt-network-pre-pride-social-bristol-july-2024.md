The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join like minded Civil Servants for our monthly social on the 2nd Thursday of the month.

Taking place just 2 days before Bristol Pride, this social will give you the opportunity to meet your fellow Civil Servants who will be marching the parade with you, and collect your Civil Service LGBT+ Network T-Shirt.

Someone from the network will be at the venue from around 17:00, and the event will officially end at 19:00, although you may find many people stick around afterwards too.

R﻿egistration is not mandatory, but if you do have any questions, suggestions, or would like to be added to our South West comms channels, please do get in touch with your South West local reps - [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt)
