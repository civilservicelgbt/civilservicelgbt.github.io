The collection was taken for Gay Times and All Points North magazines in the 1990s when Stuart was a scene reporter under the pseudonym of Linden due to his daytime work in education and the draconian law section 28. Rediscovered in the COVID-19 years and digitised, then posted onto @linden_archives Instagram the collection has led to 2 books and numerous interviews including Attitude and i-D magazines and, on the BBC TV, and radio.

Books and prints will be on sale at the event.

Linden will be in discussion with CJ De Barra from the Notts Queer History Archive to talk about the 90's queer scene. The show will include photographs from Nottingham and the midlands from the era.

**Members of the East Midlands CSLGBT will meet at the Pride Shop on Maid Marian Way at 18:00.**
