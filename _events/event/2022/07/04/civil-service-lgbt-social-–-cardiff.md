The Wales team from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network are holding a social event at the Queer Emporium, St Mary's Street, Cardiff, on Tuesday 19 July. We'll be there from 16:30 onwards, so this is a great opportunity to get to know some of your fellow LGBTQ+ civil servants!

The Queer Emporium sells both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - cocktails/mocktails, teas, coffees, etc. plus a small range of snacks. Vegan/vegetarian options are available.

If you're intending to join the march for Cardiff Pride on 27 August, this is a great opportunity to meet people ahead of time!

The Emporium is fully accessible.

To make sure we don't overcrowd the venue, please sign up to attend using the Google Forms link! If you're not able to access Forms, please email the organiser at <Bethan.Cable@crowncommercial.gov.uk>.
