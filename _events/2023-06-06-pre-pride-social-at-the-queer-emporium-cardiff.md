Pride Cymru has come early this year – if you’d like to meet some of your fellow civil servants before the march on Saturday 17 June, please join us for evening drinks and a chat at Cardiff’s Queer Emporium!

The Emporium is fully accessible and offers a range of hot and cold alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, plus a small selection of vegan food.

Depending on interest, we may move to a second venue when the Emporium closes at 18:00.

Space is limited so please register above if you intend to join us.
