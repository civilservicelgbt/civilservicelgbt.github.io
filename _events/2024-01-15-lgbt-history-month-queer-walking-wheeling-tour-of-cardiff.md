As part of our events to celebrate LGBT+ History Month, join us for a tour of some of Cardiff’s extensive queer history! Starting at the National Museum, we will be taking a leisurely guided tour of a variety of LGBTQ-related landmarks in the city centre, ending with a drink at Wales’s oldest gay bar, the Golden Cross pub. The tour should last around an hour altogether.

The tour will take place on the flat/pavement for maximum accessibility. A map of our intended route will be provided ahead of time. Friends and family are more than welcome to join in – if there’s anything we can do to help facilitate attendance, please do let us know.

In the event of bad weather, we will be running an indoor event at the Museum instead – so please come along even if it’s raining!
