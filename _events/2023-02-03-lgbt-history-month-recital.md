## Treasury Music Society LGBT+ History Month Recital 

### by musicians from the London Gay Symphony Orchestra

To mark LGBT+ History Month, the Treasury Music Society welcomes back musicians from the London Gay Symphony Orchestra: Nathan Evans (oboe) and Derek Benton (flute) with DfT Legal Advisers colleague James Adutt (piano) to perform a lunchtime recital. This year they focus on composers who lived in England: sonatas by Handel contrast with Benjamin Britten’s quirky Insect Pieces, and they end with Ethyl Smith’s magical Bonny Sweet Robin. 

Join us for an inspiring and relaxing musical break in your working day!

If you would like to attend, or watch online (either live or subsequently), please use the booking form and choose the appropriate option(s) so that the Society can monitor numbers.
