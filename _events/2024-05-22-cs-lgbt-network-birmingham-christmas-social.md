The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Our monthly West Midlands socials happen every first Thursday of the month, so why not join us! In December, we are hosting a Christmas social and will head to Birmingham Christmas Markets together to enjoy some hot drinks and treats. All civil servants are welcome to stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is highly encouraged for this event so we can communicate a meet up spot and keep you updated on our plans.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact the West Midlands local organisers.

For all the latest updates from the West Midlands region, check the West Midlands topic page. We also have a WhatsApp group where we share information and reminders of upcoming events. Please get in touch if you wish to join.
