Join fellow civil servants for a Friday Social in York.  It’s an opportunity to meet fellow civil servants, in a safe space, and network.    It’s also James’ Birthday (Yorkshire and Humber Rep) so why not join in the celebrations!? 

We’ll be meeting at Hooting Owl, York’s newest LGBT+ safe space (and where we held our recent gin tasting event) before heading into the city for an evening of delight.

New to our York social?  Look out for our group mascot (the Rainbow Unicorn).  Email [YorkshireandHumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:YorkshireandHumber@civilservice.lgbt) for more info
