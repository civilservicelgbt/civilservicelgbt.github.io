We are electing a new chair of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network.

This election operates on a 'one department, one vote' system. Departmental LGBT+ staff networks must hold an internal vote of either:

* their full membership
* their committee members

The most popular candidate in the departmental vote will be the candidate that network votes for. The candidate that wins the most departmental votes will be elected.

Departments must submit their vote during this voting window. 

Departments should read the [full election guidance](/election/2023/rules) for details on how to run their vote, and submit the results.
