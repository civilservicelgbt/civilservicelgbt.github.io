Hello! We’re running a virtual social for Civil Service staff who identify both as LGBT+ and an ethnic minority to meet others like themselves, and to provide opportunities to network. This is the first of many that we have planned, with the intention of running both online and in-person socials in various locations.

 

There’s no strict agenda, it’s an opportunity to grab your bevvy of choice and for us all to get to know another in an informal setting.

 

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact us at  <vice-chair-ethnic-minority-inclusion@civilservice.lgbt>.

 

If you know other Civil Servants that would love to join us, feel free to share the link to this page, and we’ll see you there!
