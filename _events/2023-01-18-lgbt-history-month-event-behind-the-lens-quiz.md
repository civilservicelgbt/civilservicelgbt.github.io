Wednesday 22nd of February - 12:30 - 13:30

Roll up, roll up! We'll be having a quiz and learning session around lesser known figures in theatre and film who were part of the LGBT+ community, and the impact and legacy they've had. Whether it's causing a riot with ballet choreography or finding loopholes in the Hays Code, we're here for them! Recommendations are strongly encouraged.
