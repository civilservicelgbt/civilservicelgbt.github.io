Join Five Leaves in collaboration with Notts Queer History Archive, for an evening with author Elizabeth Lovatt and a host of local lesbians. From line volunteers, to today’s switchboard, through to Nottingham’s newest lesbian events organisers Tommy on Top, it’s sure to be a fun night.


ABOUT THE BOOK
With warmth and humour, Elizabeth Lovatt reimagines the women who both called and volunteered for the Lesbian Line in the 1990s, whilst also tracing her own journey from accidentally coming out to disastrous dates to finding her chosen family. With callers and agents alike dealing with first crushes and break-ups, sex and marriage, loneliness and illness (or simply the need to know the name of a gay bar on a night out), this is a celebration of the ordinary lives of queer women.


Through these revelations of the complexities, difficulties and revelries of everyday life, Lovatt investigates the role living-history plays in the way we live today. What do we owe to our lesbian forebears? What can we learn from them when facing racism, transphobia and ableism in the community today? Steeped in pop culture references and feminist and queer theory, Thank You for Calling the Lesbian Line is a timely and vital exploration of how lesbian identity continues to remake and redefine itself in the 21st century, and where it might lead us in the future.

Elizabeth Lovatt is a writer of fiction and creative non-fiction, originally from Leicester and now living in London. She has been published by Popshot Magazine, Spread the Word, 404 Ink and Cipher Press, among others. In 2020, she was accepted onto Penguin Books’ #WriteNow mentorship scheme for underrepresented writers to develop the manuscript of her first book. She occasionally runs writing and zine-making workshops, as well as her own newsletter, the tiny narrative, which was recommended as one of the best cultural newsletters by Elephant Magazine in 2021.


Organised with the brilliant CJ DeBarra and Notts Queer History Archive- an LGBT+ history book & archive documenting and preserving the community memories from 1850-2022

We will also be joined by Tommy on Top, a lesbian events community made by lesbians, for lesbians.
“Born through a desire to connect with our community and to provide a safe space to engage meaningfully with others, we are inclusive of all lesbian gender identities and welcome those from trans and non-binary communities.”
