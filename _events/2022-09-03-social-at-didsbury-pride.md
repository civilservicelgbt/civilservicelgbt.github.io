The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

We are organising socials at some of the free Pride events as a way to get to get together to support each other and support the local community

This is a social event at Didsbury Pride (more details are available on on Facebook). One of the smaller Pride events but an event that started after sadness and a church that stood together you can read more at [Why Didsbury Pride? - St James and Emmanuel](https://stjamesandemmanuel.org/didsburypride/).

This is a free of charge and unticketed event but please register so we can share times and meeting spots and contact details so you can find us on the day.
