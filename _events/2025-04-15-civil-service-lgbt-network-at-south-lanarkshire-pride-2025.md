Thank you all for signing up to join the Civil Service Network at Pride South Lanarkshire in Hamilton on Saturday 2nd August. We will be taking part in the pride parade this year with our Civil Service LGBT+ Network branded t-shirts and banners.

If you have let us know already that you are unable to attend but are still on this mailing list, please accept my apologies.

We are really looking forward to participating in South Lanarkshire pride for the first time; to help us coordinate activities and help us lighten the t-shirt load on the day if you are able and willing to collect your Civil Service t-shirt before the parade day that would be great.

 **I will be in the HMRC Glasgow, Floor 2, Area B , Debt Enforcement (keep turning left when you come in the doors) on Wednesday 30th July and Friday 1st August. Don’t worry if you can’t collect your t-shirt on these dates or from this location as you will be able to collect them from us before the Parade starts on the day.**

**Here’s some handy info for this year’s Pride SL in Hamilton!**
