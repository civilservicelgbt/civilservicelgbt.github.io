The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join like minded Civil Servants for our monthly social on the 2nd Thursday of the month.

This social is an opportunity to meet others attending the Pride parade on Saturday 12 July and collect your Civil Service T-shirts ready for the big day! 

Someone from the network will be at the venue from around 17:00, and the event will officially end at 19:00, although you may find many people stick around afterwards too.

Registration is not mandatory, but appreciated.
