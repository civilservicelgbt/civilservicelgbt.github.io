These fortnightly informal coffee mornings are a chance to meet LGBT+ women cross government and chat to new people. There won’t be an agenda or plan for these sessions. Bring a brew and take some time out of your day to unwind. 

You can attend these events if you are:

• a cisgender or transgender woman, non-binary, femme or questioning, and

• LGBTQ+

S﻿ome people have their cameras on in these calls but it isn't mandatory at all, do what's comfortable for you.
