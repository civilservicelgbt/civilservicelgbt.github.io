Come to join us at the large table area by the smaller kitchen/refreshment hub on the sixth floor at Unity Square.

We will have the rainbow flag laid out, so you can easily find us. 

Please feel free to bring your lunch/tea/coffee/cake with you. You will have the opportunity to meet and talk to other LGBTQ+ colleagues in the region, from all departments who are based at Unity Square.
