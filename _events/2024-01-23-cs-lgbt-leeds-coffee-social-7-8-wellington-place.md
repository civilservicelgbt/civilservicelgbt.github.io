We are hosting a 7 & 8 Wellington Place Lunchtime Coffee Social, so why not join us! 

Starting from 13:30pm – 14:30pm, stop by for a hot drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email:  Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt 

Please note – due to building security arrangements – this social is only available for colleagues based within 7 & 8 Wellington Place.   Look out for our regular open Coffee Social (date tbc in Feb)
