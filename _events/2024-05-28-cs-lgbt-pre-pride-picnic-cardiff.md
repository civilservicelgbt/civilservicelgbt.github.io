As a chance for you to meet some of the civil servants who will be marching in this year’s parade, bring a packed lunch (or takeaway!) and join us for a friendly picnic in Alexandra Gardens. We’ll be there from 12:30 – 14:00, but don’t feel you have to stay the entire time.

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town). Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends!

So that we can keep track of numbers, please if possible let us know if you plan to attend.

Event Location: Meeting at the Gift of Life Stone in Alexandra Gardens (just off College Road). In the event of inclement weather, we’ll have an ‘indoor’ picnic in the Welsh Government offices at Cathays Park 2, so please bring ID with you to enable us to sign you in!
