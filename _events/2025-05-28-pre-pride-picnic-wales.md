Ahead of this year's Pride Cymru, bring a packed lunch (or takeaway!) and come meet some of your colleagues from across the civil services and wider public sector for an informal lunchtime picnic in Alexandra Gardens, Cardiff!

Alexandra Gardens are accessible and seating is provided. Please bring your own food and drink to the event. We’ll be there from 12:30 – 14:00, but don’t feel you have to stay the entire time.

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town), as is anyone who works in the wider public sector.

Please register at the email address above to enable us to sign you into the nearby Government offices if weather is poor on the day of the event. You will also need your government ID if this happens!
