From Saffo in Ancient Greece, to gender diversity in Bronze Age Iraq; from bisexuality in the Roman Empire, to transgender communities in South Asia; and more! Using images and objects from the National Museum Wales collection, we will embark on a journey as old as humanity itself to explore gender and sexual orientations in the ancient world.

Back by popular demand, PRISM’s own Dr Alessandro Ceccarelli is Head of LGBTQ+ Policy for the Welsh Government. He has extensive research and policy experience in equality and human rights, building on his previous career in academia and almost 14 years in the third sector in various countries. Previously, he completed a PhD at University of Cambridge on ancient and modern societies in South Asia, and human behaviour concerning shared identities and community networks.
