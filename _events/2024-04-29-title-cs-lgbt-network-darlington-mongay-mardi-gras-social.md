The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Darlington Economic Campus Departmental Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on the Mongay Mardi Gras Social. 

Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday (French translation) is symbolically a party or carnival to consume fat laden foods prior to the start of the Christian festival of Lent.  It has been appropriated by the LGBT+ community for a good excuse to party and in Sydney represents one the largest LGBT+ festivals in the world.

We don’t recommend consuming high amounts of fat and cannot promise Mongay Mardi Gras will be on the scale of Sydney Mardi Gras but why not come along anyway.  Look out for Martin and/or his inflatable Unicorn. 

The event timings are just for the meeting point and should attendees wish we will move on to the various venues after this, likely to be the Old Dun Cow/Avalon/Hoskins.  Any latecomers should go to either of these venues close to the Juniper Tree and find the group.  The event will end when people want to go home

Starting at the Juniper Tree, 25 Grange Road Darlington DL1 5NA, a short walk from the Market Square and One Bar, if arriving at Darlington station walk down the hill and keep going until you reach the town and the Market Square in the centre.
