Join fellow Civil Servants for a social this December.  

Someone from the network will be at the venue from around 17:30, and the event will officially end at 19:30, although people may stick around afterwards too.

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [southeast@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southeast@civilservice.lgbt)
