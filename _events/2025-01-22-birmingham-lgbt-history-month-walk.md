Join us to celebrate LGBT+ History Month 2025 with an afternoon stroll in and around Birmingham city centre. During the walk we will visit some of the infamous landmarks which have played an important part in Birmingham's LGBT+ history and culture. It will also be a great opportunity to network with colleagues and celebrate our shared history.

If you want to join us, please register your attendance. We will take steps to ensure the planned route is as accessible as possible, but please contact us to discuss any specific requirements.
