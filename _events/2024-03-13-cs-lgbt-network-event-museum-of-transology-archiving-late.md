The Museum of Transology are running drop-in archiving sessions to catalogue donations for their collections, such as photos and signs. See more details about their project here [https://www.museumoftransology.com/volunteer](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.museumoftransology.com%2Fvolunteer&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7Cc782c8d75bdb4519e8f508dc433e91a7%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638459183216463981%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GkmtrUyM8K%2BGebNcOoP78Am%2Bo0HwN6WQDFHNaH3j5Co%3D&reserved=0) or their Instagram account @museumoftransology

As the CS LGBT+ London team have decided to head along to help out this Wednesday, we thought it apt to open the invitation up to any other Civil Servants who would like to come along and join us. If you’ve ever been interested in learning about archiving, why not do it to help for The Museum of Transology.

Once we’ve helped all we can, we’ll aim to find a café nearby for those who wish to carry on networking.

For accessibility needs, please get in touch at [enquiries@bishopsgate.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@bishopsgate.org.uk) or alternatively, contact us and we can find this out for you.
