The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year.

So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants at The Pink Picnic. The Pink Picnic is Salford’s annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans & Non-binary, plus pride celebration. The event takes place in Peel Park, Salford and is organised and delivered by Salford Pride.

Unfortunately your North West Local Organisers are unable to make this event but one of our wonderful members Matt will be saving you all a space! Starting from 13:00 on the Saturday, stop by for a chat, catch up and even maybe a drink or bite to eat - it is a picnic after all!

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt) (ideally before 20th June). Look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag and banner on the day!

Tickets are required for this event, these should be purchased directly with The Pink Picnic via Skiddle: <https://www.skiddle.com/festivals/the-pink-picnic/>
