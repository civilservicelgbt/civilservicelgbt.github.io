NNEW DETAILS ADDED

T﻿IME - 1400

Meeting point: the Main Café. I will have a rainbow flag on the table. If there are no tables, I will be carrying it.

I have a few pieces I’d like to bring out in the tour with some interesting history however if anyone is keen for more, the official V&A LGBT+ tour is on later in the afternoon at 4pm. Unfortunately, the V&A weren’t able to provide a script or head pieces to help hear the guide over the background noise. Based on feedback from the last tour, I have explored the V&A LGBT blog to create our own tour with print outs in case the museum is noisy again.

Please note, I have moved the original time on the website to 2PM to reduce any time between our tour and the official one for anyone who would like to do both.  

If you are running late on the day, please send an email to the registration email for additional contact details.

The London CSLGBT+ team invite you to join them at the V&A for another LGBT tour (perfect for those who missed the first time, but also so much more to learn for those who came along to the first LGBT+ tour last year). This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us at the Main Café before we start to explore the museum. 

Tickets aren’t needed to enter the museum and admission is free. 

The museum’s accessibility information for the venue can be found here <https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/disability-access> . As the event is on a Saturday, the museum may be busier and louder than normal. If you have any requests that would make it easier when coming to the event, please let the museum know, or let me know and I can pass this on to the museum if you’d like.  

Please note, access to the Museum is also open to all members of the public. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit the Museum, they are most welcome to join.  

Please do get in contact with the team should you have any questions or feedback - [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt).
