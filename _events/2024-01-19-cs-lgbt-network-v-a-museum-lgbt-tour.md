The London CSLGBT+ team invite you to join them at the V&A for another LGBT tour (perfect for those who missed the first time, but also so much more to learn for those who came along to the first LGBT+ tour last year). This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us at the Main Café before we start to explore the museum. 

Tickets aren’t needed to enter the museum and admission is free. 

The museum’s accessibility information for the venue can be found here <https://www.vam.ac.uk/info/disability-access> . As the event is on a Saturday, the museum may be busier and louder than normal. If you have any requests that would make it easier when coming to the event, please let the museum know, or let me know and I can pass this on to the museum if you’d like.  

Please note, access to the Museum is also open to all members of the public. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit the Museum, they are most welcome to join.  

Please do get in contact with the team should you have any questions or feedback - [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt). 

T﻿IME IS TBC AT THE TIME OF POSTING. THIS NOTE WILL BE REMOVED WHEN THE TIME IS CONFIRMED.
