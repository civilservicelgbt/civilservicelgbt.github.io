**It is almost time for the Civil Service LGBT+ Networks presence at Manchester Pride.** 

All of our plans for the day can be seen below. Please note that the parade position and timings at this stage may change, as Manchester Pride have not confirmed our positioning yet. Please check back here on 23 August 2023 where it will show the confirmed details. If you have any further questions please get in touch with you local North West Reps at [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](<mailto: northwest@civilservice.lgbt>).

We are aware that there are transport strikes on the day of the parade, due to this we are aware that there might be some spaces available at short notice on the day. If you wish to join us parading please get in touch with us at the email above or just turn up at the meeting point on the day at 1100.

A﻿s always we cannot control the weather, the time at the muster point and on the parade can be a while, please be prepared for whatever the weather decides to throw at us - suncream, poncho, coat, water, refreshments. Most importantly we are representing the Civil Service so please remember this when in your pink t-shirt at the muster point or on the parade route. 

**General Plan for the day**

Meet at Castlefield Bowl, take part in the parade and post-parade take a group photo on the lawn areas where the parade ends. If you do not wish to be in the organised group photos or on any random photos taken during the day please let one of the organisers know.

Following photos, we plan to grab a drink in a bar outside of the Village area before heading back into the Village and festival areas for those that wish to join. Location of post parade drink will be confirmed on the day. 

**What to wear for the day & Extra decorations**

T-shirts will have already been provided or available on the day if you haven’t collected. If you are wearing drag, fancy dress or alternate clothing please respect the Civil Service Code.

Wear comfy shoes as it can be a long day, parade accessories will be provided including hand waving flags, whistles, and face paints etc. We will also have Civil Service branded banners, flags, and a wide selection of pride flags 

*F﻿ollowing the parade people are free to keep their t-shirts. If you do not wish to keep this the local team will collect these at the end of the parade. All Civil Service branded flags and banners and all large pride flags borrowed should be returned at the end of the parade.*

Please remember to bring a spare t-shirt / change of clothes post parade if planning to drink!

**Meeting Point**

We will be meeting at **Castlefield Bowl** (off Rice Street, M3 4JR) **from 1030, please arrive before 1100**. Everyone will need to collect a Parade Wristband so please find Ian, Laura, Scott, or Ross on arrival to collect.

We will have our Civil Service Banner up and provide the wristbands needed along with any t-shirts that are being collected on the day. Scott and Ross are the nominated responsible persons for the parade. Look for the sea of pink, all our merchandise matches our t-shirts!

**Rules for the day**

All participants must have a Parade Wristband, as above these can be collected from Ian, Laura, Scott, or Ross on the day. Scott and Ross are the nominated responsible persons for the parade. **We must all always adhere to the Civil Service Code**.

Rules from Manchester Pride:

* Glitter cannons are not permitted anywhere along the route due to the cleaning costs associated. Any clean-up costs will be passed back to the offending entry, and they may be prohibited from taking part in future Parades.
* Please ensure children are always supervised. Children under 10 years of age must be seated and wearing a seat belt if travelling in a vehicle.
* Nudity, simulated sex, or lurid acts are strictly forbidden.
* No alcohol is to be consumed at any point before or during the Parade. Any persons found with alcohol may be asked to leave the Parade.
* In the interest of animal welfare, pets are not permitted along the Parade Route.
* Flags, props, or banners must not be waved over the Metrolink cross-over point on Peter Street due to live overhead power lines.

**R﻿unning Late?**

If you are late on the day please get in touch with the local reps at the email at the top of this information bundle.

**Accessibility Guide**

The parade route itself is suitable for walkers and wheelchairs, if you need assistance, please let us know if you haven’t already and we will happily make any adjustments or arrangements where possible.
Accessibility – Manchester Pride will have more information for the Village and festival areas.

**Further Wristband Information**

Sadly, the Parade Wristband you will receive on the day is not the same as a ticketed and paid for Manchester Pride Day or Weekend Wristband.

As Canal Street and the Village area is a public right of way you shouldn’t need a Manchester Pride Wristband to enter, however, to enter any stages, events or festival areas ran by Manchester Pride they will be required. 

Purchasing a Manchester Pride Wristband is a personal choice. Please refer to the Manchester Pride FAQs for clarity:
