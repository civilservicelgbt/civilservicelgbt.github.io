**Natural England’s hugely successful Pride in Nature event returns on 3 March to show that everyone is welcome in the natural environment.**

This unique online event will bring together exciting and inspirational speakers from across the LGBTQIA+ community, partner organisations, television and environmental conservation on Thursday 3rd March 2022 from 09.15am till 12.15pm. This year’s event will be chaired by Cath Tomlin, MBE, head of diversity & inclusion at Sustrans, the active travel charity making it easier for people to walk and cycle. Cath received an MBE in the 2020 New Year’s Honours for services to the LGBT+ community. Cath will be joined by Dan O’Neil, wildlife presenter and independent filmmaker as well as speakers from the National Trust, the RSPB and many others.
 
James Diamond, Natural England Director and Pride in Nature Convenor said: “For this year’s Pride in Nature Natural England has worked with an even more diverse range of partner organisations.  This year’s theme is about understanding how we make the natural environment sector a place where everyone is welcome. We’ll be exploring that through personal stories, insights, discussions and interactive sessions with our inspiring speakers”
