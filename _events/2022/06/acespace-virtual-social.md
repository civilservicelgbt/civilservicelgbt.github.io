AceSpace is a social event for civil servants on the ace and aro spectrums, including asexual, grey-asexual, demisexual and aromantic people. This is often an underrepresented group within the LGBT+ community with few visible role models, so this event was created to give aces and aros a space to meet and chat.

This event will include a quiz and as June is Pride Month we will also be discussing ace/aro attitudes to Pride and whether Pride is ace/aro inclusive.

The event will be hosted over Teams. Please sign up using your government email address. If you have any questions about the event please contact <robin.tamblyn@rpa.gov.uk> or <justin.pugh@cabinetoffice.gov.uk>
