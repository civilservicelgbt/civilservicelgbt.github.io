The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

This event is in Bristol. The venue changes regularly, so check back on this website a few days before the event to find out the exact venue.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [South West local organisers](/team).
