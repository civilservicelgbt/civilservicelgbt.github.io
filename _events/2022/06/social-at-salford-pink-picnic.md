The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

We are organising socials at some of the free Pride events as a way to get to get together to support each other and support the local community

This is a social event at [Salford Pink Picnic](https://www.pinkpicnic.org.uk/). It is a ticketed event and available free or with a donation from the website. Please read their website for health and safety restrictions.

Please register here so we can share times and meeting spots and contact details so you can find us on the day.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
