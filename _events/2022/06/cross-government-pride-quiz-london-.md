It's been a long time coming, but the cross-government Pride Quiz Night is back. After the events for 2020 and 2021 were cancelled due to COVID, we're really keen to make this evening a success. Don’t worry if you don’t identify as LGBT+ – the questions will be for everyone.


Please [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/CDgJr8f6KCmbUCVX9) to register so we can sign you into the building and gauge numbers attending. 



Please also share with any friends and colleagues in the Civil Service who might be interested in attending. Last time we had a fantastic turnout of 120 people, which we would love to see happen again.


## When and where?

Monday 27 June 2022 in the 1 Horse Guards Road (Treasury) canteen. The event will kick off at 6.30pm, though please feel free to come along from 5.30pm to grab the best table and get yourself settled. This will also help ensure that everyone can get through security in time. The quiz should finish at about 8.30pm.

## Teams

Teams for the evening should be no more than 6 people. If you can’t get a team together then don’t worry - last time we had a great success putting individuals and smaller teams together on the night, so please come along and you’ll have a fantastic time. 

## Arriving at the venue

If you’re based outside 1HGR/100PS, you will need to sign-in when you arrive. Enter via the 1HGR entrance (by St James’ Park) and head to reception to sign in. Those of you with a red, yellow or green cross-Whitehall pass will be able to get an unescorted pass. Those without a cross-Whitehall pass, and those with a blue pass will need escorting the very short distance to the canteen. If you require wheelchair access, there is a ramp from the pavement and an accessible lift to take you to the ground floor.

## Fundraising

Although the quiz is free to enter, we are asking attendees to make a voluntary, charitable donation.

## Refreshments

Food: Please bring along any snacks for the evening, though please think of the comfort of fellow attendees e.g. not everyone is a fan of the smell of smoked haddock.

Drinks: Alcohol will not be permitted though please bring along any soft drinks you fancy for the evening. Non-alcoholic beers and ciders etc. are allowed (non-alcoholic Guinness is fabulous). The quiz should finish by 8:30pm.
