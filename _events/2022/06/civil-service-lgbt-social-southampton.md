The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [South East local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
