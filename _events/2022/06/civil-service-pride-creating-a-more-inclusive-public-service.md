To have a happy and functioning public service, it’s vital to build a public service that works for everyone.

From making LGBT+ public servants feel comfortable in the workplace, to designing more inclusive policies for all, ensuring LGBT+ equality in the public service is key.

Join this free online workshop, organised by Apolitical in collaboration with the UK’s Civil Service LGBT+ Network in honour of Pride Month, to learn about how to build a more equitable public service for LGBT+ public servants.

# Who should join

This workshop is for any public servant or policymaker who wants to learn how to build a more equitable public service, whether or not you’re part of the LGBT+ community.

This workshop will be recorded and the recording will be sent to all registrants.
