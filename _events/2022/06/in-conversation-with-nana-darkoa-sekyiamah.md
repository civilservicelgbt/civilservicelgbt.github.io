# The Summer Book Festival

The Summer Book Fest is bringing some of the most exciting voices in writing today to the civil service over the summer!

Every week of June, July and August, we’re running a session with a featured author to discuss themes in their work, read some of their writing, and answer audience questions. While the jury is still out on whether reading makes us better people, we hope the festival will be a source of joy, reflection and engagement with a diverse set of voices.

Whether just joining one session, or attending all – everyone is welcome to join CSRF's Summer Book Fest.

**Please note this event is ONLY open to colleagues with a gov.uk email address, please do not register with your personal email.**
