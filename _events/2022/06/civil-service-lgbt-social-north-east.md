This is the slot for our second virtual social as a North East region - we are hoping this will be a chill space for anyone to come and say hi and get to know other people in the area. It will be pretty informal, and if you don't wish to put your camera/mic on, you are very welcome to join and just use the chat. 

We will be around for the duration of the meet up, but you are welcome to dip in whenever suits you for however long you're free. Also, this is the penultimate social before UK Pride in the summer, so hopefully we can use this space to get a sense of numbers of people interested in attending with us as part of the Civil Service. 

Whilst this group is inherently connected to our work lives, this is a social and support space first. 

We have a Whatsapp group to allow for more informal connections, if you ask either myself or Sean we can send it to you directly, and we will send it to the chat during the session as well.

Link to Teams will follow by email once you've signed up. 

Hopefully see you soon!
Sean & Emily
