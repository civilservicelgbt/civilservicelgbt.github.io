The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

We are organising socials at some of the free Pride events as a way to get to get together to support each other and support the local community

This is a social event at Didsbury Pride (more details are available on on Facebook). One of the smaller Pride events but an event that started after sadness and a church that stood together you can read more at [Why Didsbury Pride? - St James and Emmanuel](https://stjamesandemmanuel.org/didsburypride/).

This is a free of charge and unticketed event but please register so we can share times and meeting spots and contact details so you can find us on the day.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
