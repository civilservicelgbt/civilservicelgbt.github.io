This is our first social as a North East region - we are hoping this will be a space for anyone to say hi and get to know other people in the area ahead of any in person meet ups later in the year.

It will be pretty informal, we will probably prep some ice breaker questions just to get everyone talking but hopefully nothing too painful! If you don't wish to put your camera/mic on, you are very welcome to join and just use the chat. 

We will be around for the duration of the meet up, but you are welcome to dip in whenever suits you for however long you're free. It would be great to see all the LGBT+ civil servants in the North East come together, especially with UK pride coming to Newcastle later this year, and so much LGBT+ presence across the region. We have some ideas of things we'd love to do as a group but totally open to suggestions. 

We are hoping that this space will have monthly meet ups, but will also give the opportunity for others to connect outside of the network, for example if there are other LGBT+ events in the area that people would like to attend. Whilst this group is inherently connected to our work lives, this is a social and support space first. 

If you can't make it, please contact us at northeast@civilservice.lgbt and we will keep you updated about future events.

Hopefully see you soon!
