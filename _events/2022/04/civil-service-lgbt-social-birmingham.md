The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

Our Birmingham socials usually take place on the **first Thursday of each month**. We usually skip the January event.

The venue for our socials sometimes change, so check back on this website a few days before the event to find out the exact venue. 

If you have any questions, an idea for a venue, or you're willing to help organise a social yourself, please contact our [West Midlands local organisers](/team).

> **Lateral flow before you go**. Please ensure you take a lateral flow test before attending this event and follow relevant public health guidance.
