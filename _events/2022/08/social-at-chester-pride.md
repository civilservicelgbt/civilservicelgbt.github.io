The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.
We are organising socials at some of the free Pride events as a way to get to get together to support each other and support the local community.

This is a social event at Chester Pride with the possibility of being in the parade joining up with the Environment Agency but this is not as yet confirmed but the social gathering will go ahead either way.
This is a free of charge and unticketed event but please register here so we can share times and meeting spots and contact details so you can find us on the day.

This event is free but they are operating a drink token scheme at the event , please see the [Chester Pride website](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/chesterpride20161/716517)
