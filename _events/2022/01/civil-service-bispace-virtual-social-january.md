The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. 

This month’s BiSpace social will be held online. Come along to our first virtual social of the year, an informal chat about Bi+ culture and our favourite fictional characters, celebrities, sports people, musicians etc.  Who do you admire? Have you ever met them, did it go well, or did it bring to mind the old adage “never meet your heroes”?

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact <sunny.thompson@civilservice.lgbt>.
