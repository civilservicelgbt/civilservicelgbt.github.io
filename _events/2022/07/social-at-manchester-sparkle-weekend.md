The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

We are organising socials at some of the free Pride events as a way to get to get together to support each other and support the local community

This is a social event  on the Sunday of the [Sparkle Weekend](http://www.sparkle.org.uk/). This is a free of charge event organised by Sparkle who are The National Transgender Charity which began and  organise the annual Sparkle Weekend, hosted in Sackville Gardens in the heart of Manchesterâ€™s Gay Village.
