The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Service's presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

Find out more on our [Pride 2022 topic page](/pride-2022).

## Joining instructions 

This guidance is for civil servants who are joining the cross-government Pride in London parade group on 2 July 2022.

### This year's parade theme and our group

#### #AllOurPride

This year's Pride in London theme is #AllOurPride. 

Tweet us [@cslgbt](https://www.twitter.com/cslgbt).

### Meeting points, arrival times, and parade times

#### Initial meeting point

Our initial meeting point will be Grosvenor Square, on the south side, opposite The Biltmore.

You should aim to arrive at 13:00. Wristbands, t-shirts, banners and placards will be distributed between 13:00 and 14:30

We will leave the meeting point and move into the parade form-up area near Hyde Park at around 15:00.

#### Lining up in the parade

Our group needs to arrive at the Parade form up area at 15:30.

We expect our parade group to start in the parade between 15:30 and 16:30. The parade route takes around 60 minutes to complete.

Please note we can join from the North and East of the park only due to road closures. We suggest travelling to either Marble Arch or Bond Street and walking down towards Grosvenor Square. 

There will be no late admittance to the parade group, if you are running late on the day please let one of the organisers know.

### Wristbands

All members of our parade group are required to wear a wristband, provided by Pride in London. You will need a wristband to access the parade waiting area, and may be refused entry if you are not wearing one.

**We will only be handing out wristbands on the day**. You can collect your wristband on Saturday afternoon between 1:00pm and 2:45pm at our initial meeting point at Grosvenor Square.

Wristbands will be given to those who registered in advance first.

Any wristbands that are uncollected by 2:45pm will be handed out to others so that all those that want to participate can do so. **If you were unsuccessful in securing a place online** and want one of our spare wristbands to join the group, please arrive at 1:30pm at the meeting point.

### If you can no longer attend

If you can no longer attend please let us know as soon as possible by emailing [pride@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride@civilservice.lgbt) so that it can be offered to someone else. We have people on our waiting list – please don’t let them miss out!

### The Parade

#### The route

As this is the 50 year anniversary of Pride in London [the route](https://prideinlondon.org/parade/map) is slight different to previous years, it will run from the top of Hyde Park near Marble Arch down to Whitehall. 

#### During the parade

Remember, you are representing the Civil Service and government at this event, so you:

- **must** adhere to the Civil Service Code at all times
- **must not** promote any political messaging during the parade, or do anything that might be perceived as jeopardising your impartiality
- **must not** drink alcohol on the parade route or bring glass bottles to the parade form up area or parade route

Additionally, Pride in London have asked that:

- you **do not** hand out stickers during the Parade
- you **do not** use confetti cannons, coloured smoke or throw things into the crowd
- you **do not** bring pets (except guide dogs) on the Parade route

### Dress code and t-shirts

You should wear suitable clothing for the event, but there is no set dress code. Remember that you are representing the government at the event — so please don't wear anything that might cause embarrassment to you, the group or the Civil Service. 

#### T-shirt collection

T-shirts are being provided with Civil Service Pride branding to all attendees. These t-shirts are free of charge. 

You can collect your t-shirt in advance at the following times:

- 29 June 2022
- 30 June 2022
- 1 July 2022 from 13:00 to 15:00

The collection point is the waiting room of the Department for Education. The Department for Education is located at Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith Street, London, SW1P 3BT. The waiting room is located to the left of the reception desk. 

If you are unable to collect your t-shirt in advance, it will be brought to the initial meeting point.

### Weather

It is likely to be warm and sunny on the day. Please bring water in *plastic* bottles and ensure that you are wearing suncream.  

### After the parade: social

We will be holding post-parade social at the Civil Service Club in Westminster. We are operating a guest list to access the social: if you are not on the guest list, or if you are not already a member of the Civil Service Club, you will not be able to enter the venue.

If you attend the parade as part of our parade group, you are already on the list.

Please note that the venue is limited in size, and so you may be refused entry if the venue is full. If the venue is full, we'll overflow into St James's Park.
