How can Pride be implemented in the commercial space? 

Winners of the Government Commercial Function Diversity and Inclusion Award, the Home Office Commercial Pride Team offer an insight into their unique supplier network, which involves networking with suppliers, understanding which organisations are leading on raising awareness, and ensuring that suppliers have the same ethics and values as the organisation. The team will offer an insight into how social value in terms of Pride has been implemented across the organisation, and will offer novel recommendations concerning how other organisations can channel Pride in commercial.
