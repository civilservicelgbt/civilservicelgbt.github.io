Have you ever wondered what it was like to be an LGBT+ person in London in the 20th century?

What places did LGBT+ people frequent at that time? 

Where did famous LGBT+ people of the time live? 

What was it like in London at that time? 

Join us on Sunday 29 May 2022 at 11:00  as we do a walking tour through London pointing out various  landmarks, pubs and clubs with 20th Century LGBT+ connections.

It should be a fun day out with plenty of amazing and informative stories, both good and bad. We’ll be ending the day with a few relaxing drinks and a bite to eat in one of London’s brilliant LGBT+ pubs that have proudly stood the test of time.
