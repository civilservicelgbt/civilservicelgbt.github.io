The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

Our socials in Scotland alternate between Edinburgh and Glasgow and take place in collaboration with HMRC's PRISM network.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our Scotland [local organisers](/team).

For all the latest updates from Scotland, [check the topic page](/topic/scotland).
