First of all, it was absolutely lovely to meet everyone who joined us for the first North East LGBT+ Social Hour â€“ itâ€™s so heartening to see what a strong presence we have in the North East, and hopefully we can make this a regular occurrence ðŸ˜Š 

We are hoping to have an in-person social on Thursday 5th May, from around 5.30pm til 7pm (or later for those whoâ€™d like to stay longer). Weâ€™ve had quite a few good suggestions for locations for in-person socials, including the Metrocentre, Coffee Trader, and Tyneside Cinema CafÃ©, but for this first one we are hoping to host at the LGBT+ friendly venue Journey CafÃ© Bar in Newcastle. It is nearby to Monument Metro Station, Haymarket Bus Station, and there is parking at the Oxford Street car park next door, as well as cycle racks outside. It serves veggie and vegan food until 9pm, as well as alcohol and soft & hot drinks until 11pm (not that Iâ€™m expecting weâ€™ll be there til then!) so hopefully this is a good starting point for us to get together in person. 

There is no obligation to be at the social for the entire listed time, as we are aware everyone has commutes and commitments to take into account. It would be lovely to see you whenever you can drop in. 

If anyone has any feedback on the location, let us know, as we want to make sure everyone is comfortable and has good access to the meet-ups. As we develop as a group we will likely be branching out more as time goes on, so open to further suggestions for locations or activities! 

Looking forward to seeing you soon, 
Sean & Emily
