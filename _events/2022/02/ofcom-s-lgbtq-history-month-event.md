Join Ofcom’s LGBTQ+ History Month event on Wednesday 9 February, from 4pm – 6pm either online or in person at Ofcom’s Riverside House office, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA.

Ofcom will be looking at LGBTQ+ representation and experiences in broadcasting and media, both on-screen and behind the scenes, including the progress made over the years as well as where more work still needs to be done.

The event will hear from:

- *Phyll Opoku-Gyimah* (also known as Lady Phyll), co-founder of UK Black Pride and executive director of the Kaleidoscope Trust;
- *Bethany Black*, stand-up comedian, actor and writer; and
- *Shivani Dave*, physicist, presenter and producer.
 
This hybrid event will include a panel discussion, as well as an opportunity for the audience to ask questions to our speakers.
