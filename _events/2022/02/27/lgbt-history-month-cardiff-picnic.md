To celebrate LGBT+ History Month and enjoy a COVID-safe social event during half term, the Wales region of the Civil Service LGBT+ Network is holding a picnic on the steps of the Senedd. Families and partners are welcome to attend with you - or just bring yourself.

Bring your own food and drink and come meet your fellow LGBTQ+ civil servants!

**N.B. While this location has been chosen to provide some shelter in the event of bad weather, in the event of truly awful weather it may need to be called off at short notice.

This event is open to current civil servants and their families ONLY.**
