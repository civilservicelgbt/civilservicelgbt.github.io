The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location, which is also hosting UK Pride 2024.

P﻿lease meet James, your local organiser at Forecourt of Doncaster Railway Station. James will be recognisable in his pink Civil Service t-shirt. Please arrive between 0900 and 0930 so that you can be in position by 0945.

The parade this year will be marching through the town centre, down Bennetthorpe Road, before entering Town Fields where this year’s event will be held. 

This route should take no more than 45mins to complete; we could be standing for up-to two hours, however, so please bring comfortable footwear and a bottle of water.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
