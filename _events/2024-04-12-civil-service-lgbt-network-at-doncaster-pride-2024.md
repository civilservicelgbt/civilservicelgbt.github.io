The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

As I am sure you can appreciate organising such participation takes time and our final plans for the day are not yet finalised. Please check back here closer to the date for details. Start time for this event have all been put at 1030, this is the start time of the parade and this event page will be updated with meeting time and location in due course.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
