***Rough Plan for the Day***

11:00 – 11:25 - Registered attendees to meet at the Hooting Owl Distillery & Lounge on Rougier Street, where we can use the facilities prior to the parade ([What3Words](https://what3words.com/chin.sharp.window) or [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hooting+Owl+Distillery+York/@53.9585546,-1.0871583,846m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x48792fb621c63927:0x45f00007e666ded1!8m2!3d53.9585546!4d-1.0871583!16s%2Fg%2F11fpqqt7rs?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxMy4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D)).

11:25 – 11:30 - CS LGBT+ Network transits to the parade muster point.

11:30 – 12:00 - Parade formation, under the direction of the York Pride Organisation.

12:00 – 13:30 - Parade through York:  it makes its way through the streets York city centre and along Bishopthorpe Road to our Festival site on the Knavesmire, arriving between 1pm and 1.30pm (route map attached for info).

Please note:  York Pride is one of the longest parade routes in the country, covering just over 3 miles, so appropriate / comfortable footwear is advised.  Please remember to bring a bottle of water or soft drink along with you (no alcohol though – there are control orders on parts of the route that prohibit consumption of alcohol on the streets and breaches may lead to prosecution – you have been warned!) 

13:30 – 17:00 - CS LGBT+ Network disperses: members are free to stay with local organisers at the festival site – which is free to enjoy – or do their own thing.

Please note:  Although many site vendors will accept card-payments, cash is strongly advised (there have been issues with previous events owing to crowd size at the festival site).  There are no cash-machines nearby-by, so please prepare in-advance. 

17:00 onwards	CS LGBT+ Network Post-Pride Social: The Hooting Owl Distillery & Lounge

Please note:  The official York Pride afterparty will be held at Ziggy’s from 10pm – tickets required and can be purchased on the door (£7)

An email will be sent from the Civil Service LGBT+ Network Pride inbox in the week prior to the event confirming the details for the day and confirming that the website is as up to date as can be.   I have attached the York Pride information about accessibility along with other advice – please take the time to read and familiarise yourself.  

***Pre-Pride Admin, including T-Shirt Collection***

We are really looking forward to being at York pride again this year; to help us coordinate activities and help us lighten the t-shirt load on the day, if you are able and willing to collect your Civil Service t-shirt before the parade day that would be great.   We will be hosting a t-shirt collection and pre-pride social at the [Shamble’s Tavern, York](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shambles+Tavern/@53.9596297,-1.0828387,846m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x487931af456d7789:0x8e2636a5270ffe84!8m2!3d53.9596297!4d-1.0802638!16s%2Fg%2F11crzrc5_b?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxMy4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D), on Friday 6 May between 17:00 and 19:00.
