The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants at this Saturday Social in Liverpool. Starting from 2pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch! If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag!

We will firm up plans for the day nearer the time, weather dependent we are thinking of heading to the beach for a picnic, else we will plan an indoor activity like retro arcade games at NQ64! Watch this space!

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our North West local organisers.
