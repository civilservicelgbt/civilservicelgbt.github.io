The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants at this Saturday Social in Liverpool. Starting from 2pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch! If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag!

**We've decided to hit Gravity Max for a change which is a huge indoor arcade with easy access inside Liverpool ONE! Join us to play a variety of games and catch-up over a bite and drink.**
