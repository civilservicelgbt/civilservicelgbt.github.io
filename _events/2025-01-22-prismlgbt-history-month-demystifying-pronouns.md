The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with HMRC’s PRISM network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants for this History Month event.

PRISM have invited a:gender to present this session, which aims to demystify pronouns, presented by a:gender vice chair Cleo Lunt.

The session will cover:

* A brief primer on the use of language around sex and gender in the presentation;
* A discussion of what pronouns actually are;
* They/them as a singular pronoun;
* Some personal experiences from Cleo;
* Hints and tips on how to be a good ally;
* A chance to ask questions.

The session runs for an hour, between 12:00 – 13:00. If you cannot make the full session but would still like to attend, please feel free to join and leave as needed. We hope to see you there!
