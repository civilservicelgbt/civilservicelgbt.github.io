About Middlesbrough Pride – Pride in the Heart of Boro

Presented by LBGT+ charity Curious Arts in association with Middlesbrough Town Hall, Middlesbrough Council and Orange Pip Market

Venues include Orange Pip Market (Albert Road) and Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art.  The indoor stage in the Town Hall and outdoor stage in the Orange Pip Market will hold live performances throughout the day.  A Pride market and arts and crafts workshops will be held in the Town Hall and all the food stalls and bars of the Orange Pip Market will be there for your enjoyment.

**For the Saturday pride, meet up with Martin inside the Town Hall Courtyard, the official muster point for the parade from 11.30 hours until the parade starts at 12.00**, he will be wearing his pink T shirt and/or carrying a flag.  Anyone arriving after 12.00 hours please find Martin in the courtyard or just join in the parade.

T-shirts will be provided as per the registration form which the organiser will bring with him.  Wear comfy clothes including shoes, as it can be long day.  

If you wish to get into the spirit by wearing something LGBT+ appropriate for the parade please do, but bring something to cover up afterwards especially when outside the confines of the Town Hall.  This is not purely an LGBT+ event and your safety cannot be guaranteed.

Please remember that we are representing the civil service so please respect the CS code of conduct. – Whilst you may wish to attend wearing your CS T-shirt, please bring a change of top for post parade. 

There is a 3-year Public Spaces Protection order in force relating to the consumption of alcohol in specific areas within Middlesbrough and the police or council enforcement officers may issue a fixed penalty notice.  No weapons, controlled substances, alcohol or anything which may endanger life are to be brought into the Town Hall but drinks may be purchased inside.  Drinking in the street is permitted within the confines of the Orange Pip Market but not outside.

You can take a small bag to carry essentials and take home all those purchases from the market, but bag checks and searches will be in operation at the town hall, particularly for those carrying large bags

No dogs except assistance dogs are allowed 
Camp chairs (and straight chairs!) are strictly forbidden in the town hall but can be used in the Orange Pip market

If you have access or medical needs that require you to bring your own refreshments, please make yourself known to a steward at the event info points.

There are no accessibility problems envisaged.  The town hall has full disabled access and stewards will be on hand to assist.  The market is freely accessible but will be crowded. There are accessible toilets located in the town hall and Portaloo’s in the market and changing places nearby.

There will be British Sign Language interpreters for all performances and speeches which take place on the Arena stage. 

The building is wheelchair accessible, and has step-free access from street level. The main entrance to the Town Hall is via Albert Road. An additional public entrance is located on Dunning Street.

There are a number of accessible toilet facilities in the building, as well as a baby changing facility.

The majority of spaces are accessible by lift. The only spaces which aren’t served by lifts are the balcony and gallery in the Main Hall, however the stalls area of the Main Hall is served by lift and is fully wheelchair accessible.

There is an interactive screen opposite the Box Office which gives access information for each of the public spaces, and lets you watch a video of someone walking the route to your chosen space.

***P﻿lease note that the start time of this event is currently showing as 1200 - this will be adjusted when plans for the day are finalised. It will be noted here when details are final.***
