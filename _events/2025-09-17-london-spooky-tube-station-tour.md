You may have spotted a closed tube station around the Strand before, with the sign “STRAND STATION” still across the top. This is Aldwych tube station, which served as a one-stop Piccadilly terminus coming off of Holborn and closed down in 1994. Frequently used for filming scenes on London Underground platforms, in many places it has remained a time capsule – and Transport for London are running tours!

We will be going on the 19:00 “Aldwych: End Of The Line” tour on Wednesday 12th November. You will need to purchase your own ticket *[which you can do here](https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/whats-on/hidden-london/aldwych)*. Please note, you will need photographic ID to gain access to the station.

We’ll be meeting from 6pm in The Wellington (351 Strand, London WC2R 0HS) to ensure we’re able to meet the tour guide in a timely manner. We may grab a drink afterwards to debrief!

Accessibility: Aldwych station was shut down in 1994 because it was too expensive to fit lifts, so there will be a lot of steps and walking involved.
