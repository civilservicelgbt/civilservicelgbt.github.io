The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

Come along to meet like minded civil servants at the East Midlands monthly social, this will be on the 13th of October. 

The social will be held at Cured from 1615. However, if you wish to meet beforehand and arrive together then please make your way to Unity Square Bakewell Cafe at 1600.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our East Midlands team at the below email address.
