The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with HMRC PRISM LGBT+ Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants in Glasgow on Friday 29th November for our Christmas Party night.

If you are making your own way to the venue or turning up on the day, we are aiming to be there for before 6:00pm – look out for the table with the Rainbow Unicorn. Everyone is welcome.

Registration is not mandatory, but signing up will enable us keep you informed of any updates.
