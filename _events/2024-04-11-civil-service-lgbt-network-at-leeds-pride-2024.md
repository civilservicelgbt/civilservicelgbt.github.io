The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are planning on attending and parading at this location.

T﻿he parade will set off from Leeds Town Hall at 1200, we must have registered and be in position by 1130 latest. With this in mind we will be gathering at **The Hedley Verity** between 1000 and 1045. Please arrive at the meeting point in a timely manner so that t-shirts can be distributed and a pre-pride briefing can be conducted. If you have restricted mobility please contact the CS LGBT+ Network organisers. 

T﻿here is a pre pride t-shirt collection social, details of this can be found here -

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
