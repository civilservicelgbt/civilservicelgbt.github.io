Some time ahead of Saturday's UK Pride event in case anyone wants to chat or ask questions about timings and plans for the rest of the weekend. 

Also a great space to come say hi and get to know a couple of people ahead of the day if you are planning on coming alone!

We will distribute a Teams link at 12pm on Friday 22nd to everyone that has signed up. 

Look forward to seeing everyone on Saturday!
