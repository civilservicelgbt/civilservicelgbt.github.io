The Civil Service LGBT+ Network hosts a number of events throughout the year so why don't you join fellow civil servants on our November social starting at 1730 in the yard bar. If the organiser is not there by then please start without them.

Registration is not mandatory, if you are new to the network or it's your first event look out for the inflatable unicorn or reach out to the local organiser at northeast@civilservice.lgbt.

 Similarly if you have any ideas for future events, please don't hesitate to contact us at [northeast@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northeast@civilservice.lgbt).

For all the latest updates from the North East or if you would like to become part of the civil service LGBT+ network North East team check out the North East Topics page www.civilservice.lgbt/topics, join our Google Groups or Whatsapp group.
