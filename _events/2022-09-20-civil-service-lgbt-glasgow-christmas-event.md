Everyone is welcome even your family and friends, so it would be good to see as many of you as possible on 8th December. 

If you are interested in going we need confirmation and payment of £17.50 (details will be provided) by COP on Tuesday 27th September to enable us to secure tickets. 


Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you.
