## Joining instructions

### **Glasgow Pride: Saturday 16th July 2022**

Thank you for registering to take part in Glasgow Pride.

For those who have registered to take part on the day, you should arrive at the initial meeting point at the front of the Old Ship Bank by 11:00 where the t-shirts, banners and the placards will be distributed.  

[See the starting location of the march on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/b6tP6HASJKefjnuJ8). 

From the initial meeting point, the route of the Pride Parade is from Glasgow Green from 12:00, making its way through Glasgow City Centre before finishing at George Square to give easy access to the Pride Hub and community venues. 

Upon completion of the Pride Parade, at around 14:00 there will be a social event at the Butterfly Lounge. Please remember to bring ID on the day. 

If you have any queries on the day then please contact [derek.bradford@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:derek.bradford@hmrc.gov.uk).

We know that this will be an exciting day, however there are rules of the day. Please remember that you are representing the Civil Service and the U.K. Government at this event so you:

* must Adhere to the Civil Service Code at all times
* must not promote any political messaging during the parade, or do anything that might be perceived as jeopardising your impartiality
* must not drink alcohol on the parade route or bring glass bottles to the parade or parade route
