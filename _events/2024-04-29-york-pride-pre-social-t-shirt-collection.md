Join us for our York Pride Pre-Social, where you’ll be able to meet colleagues from across the Civil Service, who’ll be taking part in York Pride on 01 June

This pre-social event will also serve as a T-Shirt Collection Service.  So whether you can join us for a drink, or you’re just dropping by to collect a t-shirt for York Pride, it’ll be great to see you!

If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Yorkshireandhumber@civilservice.lgbt)
