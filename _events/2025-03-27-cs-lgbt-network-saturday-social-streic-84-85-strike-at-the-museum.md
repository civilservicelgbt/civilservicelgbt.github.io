Join the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and the Welsh Government’s PRISM Network for a Saturday social on 26 April! We will be visiting the National Museum of Wales’s exhibition ‘Streic! 84-85 Strike!’, which has a large collection of artefacts related to Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (as featured in the 2014 film Pride).

Tickets are charged on a pay-what-you-can basis; please [buy yours in advance](https://my.museum.wales/14156/14392) for the 14:45 admission time. Please meet on the steps of the Museum for 14:30 so that we can gather in good time.

After the tour, we’ll be going for a paned/cuppa… or perhaps to the pub!

The Museum is fully accessible.
