The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Welsh Government LGBTI+ Network, PRISM. So why don’t you join your fellow Civil Servants on Wednesday 10 December for our annual Christmas Social?

We will be meeting at the [South African War Memorial](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/South+African+War+Memorial/@51.4847228,-3.1790144,19z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x486e1cbaf81d4bcb:0x5ccaaabcf1045471!8m2!3d51.4845018!4d-3.1791204!16s%2Fg%2F11bwyxsjbk?entry=tts) outside City Hall, Cardiff, to spend some time at Cardiff’s Winter Wonderland event. Admission is free and the Winter Wonderland is majority accessible (with the exception of some of the rides). There are funfair stalls, a Ferris wheel, food stalls and more!

If there’s continued interest, we will then make our way to Mary’s bar on St Mary Street for around 19:00. If you’d like to meet us there instead, you’re more than welcome!

All LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town). Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends!
