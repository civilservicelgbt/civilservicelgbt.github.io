The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

T﻿o make Blackpool socials more inclusive on event days, these will now alternate between the first Thursday and first Thursday of the month, check our events page to make sure you know which day the event is.

C﻿ome along for an evening of social chatter and networking with like minded civil servants. Who knows you may even get treated to some karaoke!

K﻿eep an eye out for our unicorn mascot on the night.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
