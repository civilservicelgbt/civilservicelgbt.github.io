Hello all!

We are running our first panel event for Civil Service staff who identify as LGBT+ and an ethnic minority on **Wednesday 21st June 12.30-1.30pm** . This panel event will discuss LGBT+ and Minority Ethnic leadership looking at:

* How to ensure good practice of the LGBT+ sector when thinking about leadership towards the future?
* What are the most important qualities of a good LGBT+ minority ethnic leader in the CS and why?
* How to support colleagues and teams as leaders, particularly with those working at a targeted intersectional level?

It is with great excitement that we can announce we have an ambassador who will be sharing their lived experiences covering the above questions! You will have the opportunity to speak to a senior civil servant on LGBT+ and Minority Ethnic leadership. 

*Omar Daair was appointed as the British High Commissioner to Rwanda and non-resident Ambassador to Burundi in January 2021, and started the role in July of the same year. Omar joined the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office in 2002.*

*His career has largely focused on Africa, including roles as Private Secretary to the Minister for Africa and Deputy Head of Africa Department (East & West), as well as overseas postings to Sudan (2005 to 2008) and South Sudan (2010 to 2011). He has also worked on NATO policy and national security issues, and was posted to Washington, DC (2011 to 2014). Omar’s most recent role before moving to Kigali was as Head of Europe Department, leading EU Exit related development work in London. Omar is a graduate of the London School of Economics and the School of Oriental and African Studies. He also holds a Masters of Public Administration from the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University.*\
