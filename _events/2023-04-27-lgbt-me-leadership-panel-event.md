Hello all!

We are running our first panel event for Civil Service staff who identify as LGBT+ and an ethnic minority on **Wednesday 21st June 12.30-1.30pm** . This panel event will discuss LGBT+ and Minority Ethnic leadership looking at:

* How to ensure good practice of the LGBT+ sector when thinking about leadership towards the future?
* What are the most important qualities of a good LGBT+ minority ethnic leader in the CS and why?
* How to support colleagues and teams as leaders, particularly with those working at a targeted intersectional level?

There will be three panellists **(ideally Grade 7 and above; 2 LGBT+ and ME leaders and 1 ally)** sharing their experiences which will delve into the questions above. The event will be held on MS Teams. Panellists will talk for approx. 10-15 minutes each and then a general discussion will be held afterwards. If you'd like to volunteer as a panellist, please do get in touch by **Friday 9th June 2023**.

A﻿n MS Teams invite will be sent out after the call for volunteers has taken place.

This will be our first panel event and we intend to host more in the future. If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact us at [vice-chair-ethnic-minority-inclusion@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:vice-chair-ethnic-minority-inclusion@civilservice.lgbt).

This event is open to all, and especially allies.

Claire & Steve
