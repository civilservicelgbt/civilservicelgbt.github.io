The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

This is the first monthly Edinburgh social since Covid. Venue and date/time for future events may be subject to change based on feedback. The Regent Bar does not serve hot food.

We intend to organise our Edinburgh events near Edinburgh City Centre. The venue sometimes changes, so check back on this website a few days before the event to find out the exact venue.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our Scotland local organisers.
