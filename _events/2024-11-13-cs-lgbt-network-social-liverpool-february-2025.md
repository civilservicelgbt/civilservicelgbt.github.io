The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. Our Liverpool Socials happen every first Thursday of the month, so why not join us! Starting from 5pm - Late, stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. If you are new to the network or it’s your first event by all means reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch! If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag! We now have some reserved space in the library area, down the left hand side of the bar near the kitchen hatch.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our North West local organisers.
