The main element of our social is from 1620 at Cured. For those that are around earlier or would like to meet up beforehand we will be at Bakewell Caf√© at Unity Square at 1600 before leaving for Cured at 1615.

Our first East Midlands meet up of the new year! An informal, social gathering. Everyone is welcome to our friendly meet up. Cured is a small venue, a very short walk from Unity Square and the train station.

If you have any questions before the day, please email cleo.lunt@hmrc.gov.uk
