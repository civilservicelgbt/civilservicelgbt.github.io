The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

W﻿elcome to our festive fling. This will be a somewhat nomadic social but we will start in our regular location, VIA. We will be at VIA until at least 1430. After VIA we will take in some of the festive sights of Manchester with plenty of options for sampling some food and or drink. If people do not wish to venture from Canal Street, that is also fine, I am sure we will be back after our City Centre tour. 

C﻿hristmas jumpers look fetching on everyone, right, so they will be heavily encouraged but by no means mandatory. Come as you are and have a great time with a friendly bunch for a festive social. 

Our regular Manchester socials take place on the **second Tuesday of each month**. This social is in addition to this. 

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).

Y﻿ou'll spot us with our inflatable unicorn mascot.
