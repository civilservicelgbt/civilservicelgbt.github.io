This year, we are organising a social to celebrate the Pride in Birmingham. This is an opportunity for you to gather and network with fellow civil servants and meet others heading to the Pride festival area. 

We do not have a walking group in the Parade this year due to limited funding, but we will meet after the Parade at the Victoria for drinks.

You do not need a Pride ticket for this event as the venue is outside of the festival area. However, please register above if you are coming so we can confirm the numbers with the venue and keep you updated on the plans before the event.

If you want to attend the Pride festival after the social, you can buy a ticket from Birmingham Pride website.
