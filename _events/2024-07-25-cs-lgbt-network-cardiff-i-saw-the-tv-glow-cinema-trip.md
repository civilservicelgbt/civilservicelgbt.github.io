On Thursday 1 August, we will be attending Chapter Arts in Canton, Cardiff to see I Saw The TV Glow, an atmospheric horror film by transfeminine director Jane Schoenbrun. The screening begins at 20:40, so we will be meeting in the bar downstairs from around 19:30 onwards. Please buy your ticket ahead of time, and let us know if you will be joining us by emailing [Owen.Blacker@education.gov.uk](mailto:Owen.Blacker@education.gov.uk) so we can keep you a seat with us!

Chapter Arts is a fully accessible venue.

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town.) Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends.

If bringing family, please bear in mind the movie’s age rating (15) and genre (horror drama).
