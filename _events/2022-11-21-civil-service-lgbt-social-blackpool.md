**As this is our Christmas event, why not dress festive! Christmas sweaters, Christmas Deeley boppers, reindeer antlers or fairy lights in beards etc.**

The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](https://www.civilservice.lgbt/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

Future events will alternate  between Preston and Blackpool, and will normally be the first Thursday of the month, but these may vary depending on whether there are any special events happening in the area.

Please regularly check the events page.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
