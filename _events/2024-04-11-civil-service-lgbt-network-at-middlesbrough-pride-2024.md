About Middlesbrough Pride – Pride in the Heart of Boro

Presented by LBGT+ charity Curious Arts in association with Middlesbrough Town Hall, Middlesbrough Council and Orange Pip Market

Venues include Orange Pip Market (Albert Road) Holiday Inn and Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art.  The indoor stage in the Town Hall and outdoor stage in the Orange Pip Market will hold live performances throughout the day.  A Pride market and arts and crafts workshops will be held in the Town Hall and all the food stalls and bars of the Orange Pip Market will be there for your enjoyment.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
