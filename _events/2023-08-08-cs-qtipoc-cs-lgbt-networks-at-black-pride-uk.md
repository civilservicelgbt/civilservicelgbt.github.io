A bit about Black Pride;

*The world’s largest pride celebration for LGBTQI+ people of African, Asian, Caribbean, Latin American and Middle Eastern-descent has continued to grow year-on-year. From a bus-load of attendees travelling to Southend-on-Sea to 10,000 people in Haggerston Park, UK Black Pride is proud to return to Newham, the largest space the organisation has occupied since its inception.
UK Black Pride co-founder and Executive Director Lady Phyll Opoku-Gyimah says, “when myself and a group of Black lesbians set out to create our own Pride event, as the others felt exclusive and unwelcoming, we were told we’d never get anyway. That no one would support us and that any community built around a ‘Black pride’ would fade away. Here we are, 18 years later. Bigger, bolder, braver and brighter than ever. It’s been a journey, and we have to thank everyone from the community that has been with us at every and any stage. 2023 marks a historic year for us, and to be able to return to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, where we saw 25,000 people share their joy and queerness with us, is incredible. We cannot wait to welcome our family back and continue to leave a legacy for the next generation of Black and POC queer love and progress”.*
