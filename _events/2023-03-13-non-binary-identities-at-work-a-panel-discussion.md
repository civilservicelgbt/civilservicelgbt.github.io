Transgender Day of Visibility will be marked internationally on 31st March. It is dedicated to celebrating trans and non-binary people and their contributions to society as well as raising awareness of the challenges they face. In the face of an increase in negative campaigning about trans people, it is an important opportunity to show the world that trans and non-binary people are just ordinary people: your neighbours, your friends, your colleagues; and that there is no basis for the moral panic being stirred up in some quarters.

To mark TDoV this year, FCDOâ€™s LGBT staff network FLAG, is running a panel discussion platforming a number of non-binary members of staff, to discuss their wide range of experiences and challenges at work and beyond. The session is open to everyone interested in learning more about non-binary identities, including LGBT+ staff and allies.
