Our London Women’s Inclusion team are inviting you to join them at Tate Britain for Queer and Now 2023 festival. This event is open to everyone who identifies as a woman and/or feels like this space would be suitable for them.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 09:30 at Tachbrook Bakery, 101 Tachbrook St, London, SW1V 2QA. Alternatively, you can meet us outside Tate Britain at 10.10am if running late.   

There are a number of events going on all day from 10:00 to 22:00. Please note tickets are still to be released alongside program. However, tickets will be free and will need to be booked at Tate Britain’s website here: <https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/queer-and-now-2023>.

Once available, have a look at the programme and let us know if there are any particular events you’d like to attend and we can try to team you up with anyone else in the group who’d also like to attend too. 

Please note, access to Tate Britain is also open to all members of the public and is not a women focused event. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to attend the festival, they are also welcome to join.  

Do get in contact should you have any questions or feedback. Also, if you would like to be updated when the program is announced and tickets are available, drop an email too – [oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk) .
