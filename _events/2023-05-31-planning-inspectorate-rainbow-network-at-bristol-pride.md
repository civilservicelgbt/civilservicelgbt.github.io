The Planning Inspectorate is proudly sponsoring Bristol Pride 2023.  Members of our Rainbow Network and other volunteers will have a stall in the community area of the Pride Day festival on Clifton Downs and we also hope to march in the Parade. Other civil servants would be very welcome to join us for all or part of the day! We will wear Planning Inspectorate or Civil Service LGBT+ t-shirts, though please remember to bring a change of top if you want to stay at the festival afterwards.

 

Please see the information about the accessibility of Bristol Pride on their website.  Further updates as to the parade and festival will be posted here, but please contact [Jeanie Russell](mailto:jean.russell.6g@planninginspectorate.gov.uk) to register or if you have any questions.
