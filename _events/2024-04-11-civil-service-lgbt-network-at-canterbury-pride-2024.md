The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are attending and parading in Canterbury. C﻿anterbury pride is the largest parade in Kent and it is great to be able to support this location.

Canterbury Pride stands as the pinnacle of Kent’s cultural celebrations — a vibrant, annual extravaganza that heralds the beauty of diversity within the LGBT+ community. This event shines as a beacon of inclusivity, where visibility, entertainment and joy are interwoven with the spirit of unity. It's a day where families, friends, and allies come together in a harmonious display of support, creating an uplifting atmosphere where everyone is encouraged to be their authentic selves.

As in previous years, the Canterbury Pride Committee has asked for our valuable assistance at the muster point (issuing wristbands and directing community groups). This has been a yearly offering from the network, to keep our parade entry free of charge.

Canterbury Pride Parade proceeds from Westgate Gardens, via Westgate Towers, along the highstreet, turning right at Rose Lane, across the Watling Street roundabout, and ends at the Dane John Gardens. Please ensure you bring comfortable shoes (there will be cobbles and uneven surfaces along the route).

The Parade will terminate at the Dane John Gardens, where a festival-style pride event will take place (including bars, marketplace, main-stage, and a funfair). The local organising team will be positioned close to the main-stage throughout the afternoon, identifiable by our CS LGBT+ Banner, please feel free to join us or do your own thing once the parade has ended.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable.
