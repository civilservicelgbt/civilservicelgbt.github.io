Come grab your Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, meet the team, and get ready for Pride weekend with good vibes and even better company! ðŸŒˆItâ€™s a brilliant chance to connect, catch up and celebrate who we are ahead of the big parade. Allies welcome too â€“ the more the merrier! For any questions email Local Organisers via email:Â [northwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt)

Registration is not mandatory, but by all means get in touch! If turning up on the day just look out for one of our inflatable unicorn mascots or our bright pink Civil Service Pride flag! We typically have some reserved space in the basement bar area, down both sets of stairs at the left hand side of the bar as you walk in.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our North West local organisers.
