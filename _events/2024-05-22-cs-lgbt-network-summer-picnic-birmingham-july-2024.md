The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. In July, we are hosting a summer weekend picnic, so why not join us! We will start at 12pm and all civil servants are welcome to stop by for a drink, bite or even just a chat. Please bring your own snacks, drinks and a picnic blanket if you own one (we are also bringing one and some small bites to share). 

Registration is highly encouraged so we know to expect you and can inform you of any changes. When you arrive, look out for 'Liz' our inflatable unicorn mascot.

Please note this event is weather dependant and in case of adverse weather, we will move to a pub nearby.

If you are new to the network, it's your first event, you have questions, or even an idea for a future event, feel free to reach out to the Local Organisers via email: [westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:westmidlands@civilservice.lgbt)

For all the latest updates from the West Midlands region, check the West Midlands topic page. We also have a WhatsApp group where we share information and reminders of upcoming events. Please get in touch if you wish to join.
