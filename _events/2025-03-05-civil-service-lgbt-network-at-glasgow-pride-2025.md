***T﻿his event has been updated on 11 July 2025.***

We are really looking forward to being at pride again this year; to help us coordinate activities and help us lighten the t-shirt load on the day if you are able and willing to collect your Civil Service t-shirt before the parade day that would be great.

**T-Shirts will arrive in the next few days - I will be in the HMRC East Kilbride Office, B Ground Reception area on Wednesday 16/07 and in HMRC Glasgow, Floor 2, Area B , Debt Enforcement (keep turning left when you come in the doors) on Friday 18/07. Don’t worry if you can’t collect your t-shirt on these dates or from these locations as you will be able to collect them from us before the Parade starts on the day.**

The plan for the day is as follows:

If you are travelling via the City Centre, I will be at Buchanan Street Subway station, Dundas Street entrance (opposite the entrance to Queen Street Station) from 9:30am to 9:40am and we will travel to Kelvinhall Subway station which is only a few minutes’ walk to meet everyone at Kelvingrove Art Gallery.  If you are making your own way, we will meet outside the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Argyle St, Glasgow G3 8AG between 10am and 10:15am - car park at the back entrance. We will then walk the short distance from there to Kelvingrove Park where we need to be in place for 10:30am. The Parade sets off at 12noon. From Kelvingrove Park the Parade will then go along Sauchiehall Street, Blytheswood Square , down West George Street, through George Square and Merchant City and finish at The Barrowlands Park. 

If you have any questions about the day, logistics, attendance or other please do not hesitate to reach out to us at [Scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Scotland@civilservice.lgbt). There is also a WhatsApp Group set up for the region, it is not compulsory to join, but it may be used for quick communications on and around the day. If you are not already a member and would like to join please contact your local organiser team, or email [Scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Scotland@civilservice.lgbt) with your mobile telephone number and a message advising that you would like to be added to the Scotland Civil Service LGBT+ Group WhatsApp.

Registration for this event has now closed however if u know anyone else who wants to join, please let us know. As T-Shirts have now been sent you would not be able to order one now, however we do have a couple spare, so please contact me to check.

We appreciate that plans change, and life continues at a busy pace, if your plans change for pride and you can no longer join us please do let us know at [Scotland@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:Scotland@civilservice.lgbt).

Please remember to have a change of top for post parade if you are planning to socialise and drink. We should only be wearing our CS t-shirt for the parade.

Please remember that you are representing the Civil Service at pride and must always follow the Civil Service Code of Conduct. Please do not bring any home-made signs. We will have the Civil service banners to carry.

ID is not needed for the parade itself, but if you are planning on going out afterwards then you may need/wish to bring ID with you for the day. No Civil Service pass is needed for you to join the group on the day.

Derek and Andy
