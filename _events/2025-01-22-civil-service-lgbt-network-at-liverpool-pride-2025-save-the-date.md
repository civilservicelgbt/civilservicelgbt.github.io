*U﻿PDATED ON 4 JULY 2025 - THE NEW PLAN IS BELOW.*

Thank you all for registering for Liverpool Pride and bearing with us through the several changes to our plans for the day.

The shock cancellation was a hard blow to the community and our group, we had great numbers registered to parade and so we had compiled a back-up plan to ensure the group can still get together and do some fundraising. Although, with the great news that Sahir House have quickly managed to pull together a pride parade, we have adapted our plans again to ensure the group can now join the parade.

We do still have the Atrium space at Tempest on Tithebarn Street, and we do still intend on gathering there after the parade and will still do some of the fundraising we had previously planned. For anyone who cannot make the parade timings, please still feel free to join us at Tempest at any point, we expect to arrive there after 1pm. There will also be the usual updates in the Liverpool Whatsapp group with where the group are upto, link to join [here](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.whatsapp.com%2FHUOcaMRnF5jLdBMdQMVnb7&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C336eb625536940e7e86908ddbb004b0c%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638872332181750880%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iVgYAMVowyN6APITCS8ZIXBg7%2B1kx8hAB8BC72UrIoE%3D&reserved=0).

**Please find below a plan for the day, please note the slightly earlier than usual start time and change of usual muster location.**

**Date & Time       26 July 2025 – 09:50**

                              CS LGBT+ Network Local Organisers will be at the muster point by 0940

**Location              India Buildings, Water Street, Liverpool**

                              Outside the main entrance on Water Street

**Pride Plans**

09:50 to 10:10 - Muster at India Buildings, where we will hand out t-shirts

10:10 to 10:15 - Group Photo at India Buildings

10:15 to 10:30 - Make our way to Pier Head to join the official parade muster area

*If you are late to India Buildings please make your way to Pier Head, we will share our location on Pier Head on WhatsApp when we have found a space, look out for the sea of CS LGBT+ Network pink though.* 

10:30 to 11:30 - Speeches on Pier Head

11:30 - The parade starts and moves toward the end point, M&S Bank Arena.

13:00 (estimated) - Post parade people are free to do as they please, but we do have space booked if people would like somewhere to head initially. We will collect in any t-shirts people are not keeping hold of and then make our way to Tempest on Tithebarn, 12 Tithebarn Street, L2 2DT. We have the atrium reserved under Ross Starkie’s name.

We expect to arrive at Tempest on Tithebarn between 1300 & 1400 – although feel free to arrive earlier/later than that if you are not joining us at the parade.

We are still going to have an opportunity for Spoken Word and fundraising, our prior planned activities at Tempest will be reduced, but we will still plan to hold a raffle and either a quiz or bingo.

We have the space until at least 1730, people are of course able to join us for as long or as little as they would like. It would be great to see a nice post parade turnout to raise some money for a great charity.

Registration is open and this is done by one form per event.
