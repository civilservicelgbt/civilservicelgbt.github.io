Conclude our LGBT+ History Month celebrations (overrunning by three weeks, but that’s a proud LGBTQ+ tradition anyway!) with a final lunchtime webinar on English-language LGBTQ+ terminology. Find out why gay people aren’t always happy, how to meet a Lesbian on holiday, and the sometimes-fraught history of ‘queer’ness.
