The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

On the 7th of February 2025 join us as we celebrate LGBT+ history month at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland. During our visit we will hear about the amazing work the public records office does in NI to conserve the past and hear how they are conserving LGBT+ history in the region.

Then we will get the opportunity to see the Cara-friend collection, which has been gathered over the last 50yrs of the charity. We will get an insight into the calls and letters the group received as they started out in 1974 to help the community across NI. With the chance to hear and feel what it was like for people and how invaluable the LGBT+ befriending service while being surrounded by conflict.

To hear this history is a great privilege and we hope to share it with as many of you as possible. Numbers are restricted so it will be based on a first come first serve basis. Â 

If you would like more information, please reach out to one of the local organisers via email
