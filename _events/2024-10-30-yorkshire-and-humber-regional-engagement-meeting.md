Join Regional Organisers and Reps for an engagement meeting, where we’ll reflect on the past 12 months and look at plans for the next year.

We’ll also share important updates from the CS LGBT+  Network and hear your thoughts, ideas, and suggestions for the region moving forwards.  This meeting will be held face to face, with a hybrid option for those who need it, at a venue in Leeds (likely Wellington Place).

After the meeting you are welcome to join the network for a festive drink and walk around the Leeds Christmas Markets.

Registration is mandatory, to enable access to the building.
