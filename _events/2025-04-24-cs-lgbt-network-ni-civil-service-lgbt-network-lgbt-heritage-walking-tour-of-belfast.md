The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country. This event has been organised by the NI Civil Service LGBT+ network.

The tour takes a route around Belfast stopping at places which are noted for their relevance to the history of the LGBTQIA+ community in Belfast. Many of these places will be sites you’ll have walked past dozens of times and not realised the importance of the places visited. Homophobia was rampant, and in hand with the tensions around The Troubles, being LGBTQIA+ was not easy and this struggle is definitely a recurrent theme. However, there is still humour, and the tour was uplifting as well as thought provoking and at times sombre.  The tour is scheduled to last 90 minutes. Hopefully it’ll be less cold when we go – I know it’ll be June but that means little in Belfast!

Spaces are limited so please register.
