The Civil Service LGBT+ Network are attending and parading at this location.

\-﻿--

*S﻿hort update on 16/08/2024*

We are still waiting for confirmation from Manchester Pride on our positioning for the day - we are advising members who have been successful in the ballot to be at Castlefield Bowl (On the tiered seated area) for 1030 on Saturday 24 August. We will likely be moving into the parade form up (Heritage Gardens) area shortly after this. 

Following the parade we will head to Refuge Bar, which is outside the village and hopefully offers a calmer space for members to chat and decompress from the parade. 

W﻿hen timings and parade entries are confirmed participants will be emailed and this webpage will be updated.

Please sign up to join us at this event through the link above, the same form is being used to sign up to all parades and events, so only needs to be filled in once. If you are having trouble accessing this form please email - [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt). Please also email this address or your local organisers if you are no longer able to attend an event, but have signed up.

As with previous years we will be able to supply a wonderfully charming pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirt, we are, this year more than ever, asking you to reuse a t-shirt you might have from the previous year, this both helps with financially and by helping the network be more sustainable. 

Closer to the event please remember to keep an eye out in your emails with regards to more localised communications from your local organisers or the central team. This may include instructions on where to collect t-shirts from, asking you to reconfirm your place if this is a balloted parade or something else.

Please remember that you will be representing the Civil Service LGBT+ Network and therefore the Civil Service at these events and must adhere to the Civil Service Code.
