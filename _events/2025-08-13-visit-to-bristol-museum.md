The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is heading to Bristol Museum and Art Gallery to view 2 of their current exhibits. 

Gender stories - <https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/whats-on/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/gender-stories/>

Bristol Pride x Martin Parr - <https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/whats-on/bristol-museum-and-art-gallery/bristol-pride-x-martin-parr/> 

Join fellow civil servants on a collective wander around to take in these impressive exhibits celebrating our city's diverse history and culture. 

NB: These exhibitions may contain some slogans and words, including limited profanity, which may cause offence to some people. There is also one image featuring common anti-LGBTQ+ slurs, used in the context of highlighting discrimination and reclaiming these words for the community. Please be mindful of this when we visit.

Should a large number of people register, I will need to organise a group booking. Otherwise, you do not need to book in advance. 

We will meet outside the museum, with exact location and details sent to registrees on Friday 29 August.
