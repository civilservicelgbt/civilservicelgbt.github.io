P﻿OSTPONED - This event has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Please keep an eye on the website for future opportunities, including a rearranged date for tree planting.

Join us for a Tree Planting Volunteer Day at Weaste Cemetery on 28th November, starting at 10 am. Help us green up the area and contribute to a more sustainable future. No experience needed – just bring your enthusiasm! Wear sturdy boots, a warm coat, and waterproofs if it’s wet. We’ll provide tools, gloves, and motivation to keep you going. Whether you're planting one tree or many, your efforts make a difference! Come along and be part of a fantastic community effort to improve our environment. The Cemetery is a short walk away from Langworthy Tram Stop.

There will be a volunteer contingent from Government Departments and the CS LGBT+ Network, this tree planting will not only be exclusively with members of our Network.

If weather changes where we feel it will be unsuitable to do the event we will rearrange the event so please provide us a contact number to notify you ASAP.
