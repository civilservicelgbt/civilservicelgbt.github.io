For LGBT+ History Month we will be going on a walking tour around Soho, finding out more about how this part of London has historically been a centre of the LGBT+ community – for far longer than many people assume!

We will be starting our walking tour outside of St James's Tavern on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Great Windmill Street, before travelling around the area to learn more about sites of historical significance. We estimate this walking tour will take about an hour, stopping at the current or former locations of Lyon’s Corner House, The Shim Sham Club, The French House, Au Chat Noir, The Colony Room, Le Duce, Club Louise, Trident Studios, Village, The Yard, Compton’s of Soho and The Admiral Duncan. We may head to a venue in Soho after the walking tour.

We’ll be leaving no later that 18:05 – provided you’re at the meeting point at 18:00 you’ll hear us introduce the event. If you think you may end up running late, we recommend joining our WhatsApp Group where we will be sharing our live location. Please email [london@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:london@civilservice.lgbt) with your personal phone number from a gov.uk email address for more information.

Accessibility: Regrettably Soho has quite narrow, uneven pavements and is frequently very crowded with little public seating available. If you need to take a break during the tour, we would recommend checking in with our WhatsApp group so you can catch us up!

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [London Organisers](mailto:%20london@civilservice.lgbt).
