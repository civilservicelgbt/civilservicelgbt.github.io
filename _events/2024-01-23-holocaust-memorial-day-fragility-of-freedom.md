Holocaust Memorial Day 2024: Fragility of Freedom - Survivors' testimonies.

To hear testimony from survivors of the Holocaust and the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.

Holocaust Memorial Day (HMD) takes place on 27 January 2024 and marks the 79th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. This official national day remembers the millions killed in the Holocaust, Nazi Persecution and genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur. This yearâ€™s HMD coincides with the thirtieth anniversary of the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.

Please join us either in the DfT office on Horseferry Road or virtually via Teams to hear testimonies from:

* \-Eve Kugler survivor of The Holocaust
* \-Antoinette Mutabazi survivor of the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda.
* \-Ambassadors of the Holocaust Educational Trust to talk about their project on Lessons from Auschwitz Project.

We will also be joined by Karen Pollock, Chief Executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust and Laura Marks Chair of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and watch an introduction by video from our Secretary of State the Rt Hon. Mark Harper MP.
