Muster with Martin outside of the Darlington Economic Campus (Feethams House) DL1 5AD from 1130 to move on to the Market Square for the parade at 1200. 

Any latecomers should head to the entrance of the Dolphin Centre and search for us in our pink T Shirts.  After the parade we would love to hold people together to take a large group photo provided everyone gives consent. We will inform people of where on the day. 

After the parade and photo, you are free to enjoy your time as you wish either at the festival or around Darlington itself.
