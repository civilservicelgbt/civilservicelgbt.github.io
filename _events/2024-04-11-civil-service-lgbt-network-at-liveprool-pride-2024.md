T﻿he Civil Service LGBT+ Network will be parading at Liverpool Pride again this summer. 

A﻿s usual we will muster at St Georges Plateau, we will be recognisable with our pink Civil Service LGBT+ Network t-shirts and banners. We will be given a parade block number, when we know this we will let our entrants know.

T﻿he parade route will take us from the plateau through the centre of town, zig zag-ing through the queer quarter and ending on the Pier Head. 

P﻿lease arrive at the muster point from 1030. Please try to arrive by 1115 but no later than 1130. The parade will start at 1200. If you are late, please keep in touch with your organisers and you will be able to join us late or on the route. 

F﻿ollowing the parade we will gather for a group photo before we then disperse to enjoy the rest of the day at Liverpool Pride. You are more than welcome to stay with the group or do your own thing. 

S﻿ome people that will be parading with us will be going to the Pride Classical event on the waterfront on the Friday - If you would like to meet up with fellow Civil Servants for this event, please get in touch at [pride2024@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:pride2024@civilservice.lgbt)
