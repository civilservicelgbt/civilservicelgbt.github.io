The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our local organisers organise these events in various cities across the country.

Come along to meet like minded civil servants at the East Midlands for this gallery visit. Please meet at Unity Square at 1530 to then walk over to The Contemporary together. 

There is currently an exhibition of videos with a focus on queer and feminist art, curated by Ridykulous.
