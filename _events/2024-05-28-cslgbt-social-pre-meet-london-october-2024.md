C﻿ANCELLED - Unfortunately due to resource we are having to cancel this pre-meet. The main social is still going ahead.

The London LGBT+ team would love to invite you to join them at the pre-meet before the monthly LGBT+ social at Retro Bar. This event is open to everyone who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT+ network.

The pre-meet gives a space to those who may feel more comfortable getting to know a smaller group of people before going to the larger social, or for anyone who prefers a café setting over a pub setting for a monthly chat after work.

Following some feedback, we thought we would jazz up our pre-meet social to do some café hopping around the area. As the cafés in the area are typically small, there may not always be a table free when we arrive. As such, please keep an eye on the London CS LGBT+ whatsapp or your emails on the day for more details of the location.
