Holocaust Memorial Day 2024: The Mosaic of victims of Nazi Persecution

Martin Winstone from the Holocaust Educational Trust will join us to talk about The Holocaust and the many different groups of people targeted by Nazi Persecution

We are pleased to be joined by the Senior Historical Advisor for the Holocaust Educational Trust Martin Winstone. Over a Teams call he will explain why the Nazis targeted different groups of people for persecution and then highlight some individual stories of Jewish, Black, LGBT+ and disabled people (although there were many other groups targeted by their violence).

The session will run virtually via Teams and will include:

* An overview of the groups of people persecuted by the Nazis
* Explanation of why these groups were persecuted.
* More detailed accounts of the experiences of Jewish, Black, LGBT+ and disabled people, highlighting individuals.
