After the parade we would love to hold people together to take a large group photo. We will inform people of where on the day. 

After the parade and photo, you are free to enjoy your time at Edinburgh pride as you please. Derek and Marc will happily share details of their plans, but they will not be offended if people just want to do their own thing.
T-shirts will be provided as per the registration form which Marc will bring with him.  Wear comfy clothes including shoes, as can be long day. 

Feel free to bring face paints and hand waving flags. 

If you are wearing fancy-dress, please respect the CS code of conduct. 

Please remember that we are marching under the CS LGBT+ Network Banner, so again, please respect the CS code of conduct. – Whilst you may wish to attend wearing your CS T-shirt, please consider whether you will need a change of top for post parade.
