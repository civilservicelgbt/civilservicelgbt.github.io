***T﻿his event page has been updated on 10 July 2025.***

**P﻿lan for the Day**

**Meeting point**

We will meet and gather in Castle Park, Bristol, on the southside of the bandstand. An exact what.3.words location and live location will be shared on Saturday morning via the WhatsApp group.

Please allow plenty of time to arrive and find the group and aim to arrive by 10.15. If you’re running late, don’t worry, you’ll be able to follow where we are via the live location on WhatsApp. Once the parade sets off, I may not be able to answer the phone.

**What to wear/bring**

Your CS T-shirt of course! Plus any and all Pride attire you wish! The more colours and flags the better. Once the parade is over please make sure you have something to change into to go to the festival.

The weather is looking great - bring water, suncream and hats!!

**Pictures**

I will announce ‘official’ photos to give you the chance to duck out of them, however please note that there will be a lot of phones and cameras throughout the parade.

You are all welcome (and encouraged) to take your own pics/videos, please share them on the WhatsApp if you do!

**After the parade**

In previous years, we have completed the parade by 13:00, with it ending at the Amphitheatre where we will take a group photo. This is where the official meet will finish.

Shuttle busses will be available to take you to the Downs & if you haven’t yet bought a wristband, you can do so via Bristol pride website - [https://bristolpride.co.uk/wristbands/](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbristolpride.co.uk%2Fwristbands%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cross.starkie%40hmrc.gov.uk%7C39f4ada6c9c5480a7b1f08ddbf9236a3%7Cac52f73cfd1a4a9a8e7a4a248f3139e1%7C0%7C0%7C638877356891532611%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PCKk13Dpf%2BGYCoEDc8TfFGO7JIfGmK9CaZe1Ut7cyPc%3D&reserved=0) - I’ll be there a little later so if you need company you can use the WhatsApp group to find folks!
