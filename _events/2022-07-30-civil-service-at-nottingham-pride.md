The Civil Service LGBT+ Network is coordinating the Civil Service's presence at Pride events across the UK in 2022. We are also organising an online programme of events to keep Pride On wherever you live.

We will be taking part in pride marches and parades in every UK capital city this year, as well as a number of other towns and cities across the country.

## Joining instructions


### Nottingham Pride: Saturday 30th July 2022

Thank you for registering for Nottingham Pride.
 
#### Meeting point 

For those who have registered to take part in the parade then you must arrive at the Robin Hood Statue by the Nottingham Castle by 9:30am. 

[Start Location of the March](https://goo.gl/maps/UzKygB56yRAs8S3p8)

From the meeting point, the march will set off to join the parade at 10:30am and will start on Albert Street. 

If you have any queries on the day then please contact [EastMidlands@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:EastMidlands@civilservice.lgbt). 

To note on the day, Thema will be holding the Civil Service Pride banner, so will be easy to locate. 

#### After the parade 

Once the parade route has completed then there has been a provisional booking for the Brew Dog for an after parade social. 

It is recommended that you bring photo ID with you if you intend to attend venues after the parade.

Unfortunately the location of the after parade social is not wheelchair accessible.

**We hope that you have an amazing day and Happy Pride**
