Bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation has no place in the Home Office, yet we know from the People Survey that scores for BHDV among LGBT+ colleagues is disproportionately high. To try and help with this Spectrum have put together a BHDV workshop aimed at LGBT+ staff and their managers.
