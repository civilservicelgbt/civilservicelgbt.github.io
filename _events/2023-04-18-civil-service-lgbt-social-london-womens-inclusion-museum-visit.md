Our London Women’s Inclusion team invite you to join them at Natural History Museum Lates. This event is open to everyone who identifies as a woman and/or feels like this space would be suitable for them.  

If you’d like to meet and connect with others from the network, please join us from 17:30 at the Pret a Manger, 15 Old Brompton Rd. We will be there until 18:30 before we head to the museum to start to explore. At that time you are then free to experience the museums exhibits with us or in small groups. 

The event takes place from 18:30 to 22:00, 5 May at the Natural History Museum, London. Tickets are free and need to be booked at the Natural History Museum website here: https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/lates.html .

Please note, access to the Museum is also open to all members of the public and is not a women focused event. In this regard, if you have friends or partners who also want to visit the Museum, they are also welcome to join.  

Please do get in contact should you have any questions or feedback – Oriana.moschovakis@hmrc.gov.uk; Maria.Ionescu@governmentlegal.gov.uk; valentina.shah@hmrc.gov.uk.
