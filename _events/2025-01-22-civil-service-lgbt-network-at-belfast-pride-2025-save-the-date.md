*P﻿lease note this event has been updated on 30 June 2025.*

We will be meeting at Lanyon Plaza from 10:30 on the day of the parade, breakfast will be provided courtesy of the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Shortly before 12:00 we will begin to make our way to our position in the parade. 13:00 is parade start time and we are usually finished by 14:30, after which point, we all disperse and do our own thing.

We will all be wearing our bright pink Civil Service Pride t-shirts. Beyond that please prepare for whatever weather conditions are predicted for the day.

Civil Service t-shirts will be provided to all participants. These can be collected at Lanyon Plaza before the parade. Please remember to have a change of top for post parade if you are planning to socialise and drink. We should only be wearing our CS t-shirt for the parade.

Lanyon Plaza is a short distance from Lanyon Place train station. The building can be accessed from the front entrance, and we will be on the ground floor. This building is accessible.

Please remember that you are representing the Civil Service at pride and must always follow the Civil Service Code of Conduct.

We ask that you do make every effort to arrive at the muster point before we leave for the parade, however we know this can sometimes be out of an individuals control so once we get full information on our parade starting position we will update this section to reflect that.

The parade route is 2.12km long and is entirely flat along the full route with no ramps or other impediments. Belfast Pride have partnered with Translink to provide a Pride Bus. This is transport for those with mobility issues or disabilities who want to complete the parade but cannot manage the full route. If you want to reserve a place, email [pride@translink.co.uk](mailto:pride@translink.co.uk)

Full accessibility information for Belfast Pride can be found at <https://belfastpride.com/accessibility-statement/>

Wristbands are required to walk in the parade and are on a first come first serve basis based upon registering on the CS LGBT+ Website. These can be collected on the day at the muster point, Lanyon Plaza.

Please remember that you are to follow the Civil Service Code whilst in your t-shirt and must not seen to be drinking or drunk. 

No alcohol at all is to be consumed during the Parade by spectators or participants – it is illegal to drink on the streets of the City Centre as at any other time. Full parade terms and conditions can be found at [https://belfastpride.com/parade-terms-conditions/](https://belfastpride.com/parade-terms-conditions/.)
