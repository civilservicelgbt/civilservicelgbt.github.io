The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. So why don’t you join like minded Civil Servants for our monthly social on the 2nd Thursday of the month.

Our monthly socials can change location month on month, so make sure you have checked the location for this event.

Someone from the network will be at the venue from around 17:00, and the event will officially end at 19:00, although you may find many people stick around afterwards too.

Registration is not mandatory, but appreciated.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to be added to our South West comms channels, please do get in touch with your South West local reps - [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt)
