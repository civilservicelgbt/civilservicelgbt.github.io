The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Darlington Economic Campus Departmental Network. So why don’t you join fellow Civil Servants on the Mongay Easter Hunt Social.

Starting at the Juniper Tree, 25 Grange Road Darlington DL1 5NA, a short walk from the Market Square and One Bar, if arriving at Darlington station walk down the hill and keep going until you reach the town and the Market Square in the centre.

Look out for Martin and/or his inflatable Unicorn, bring your own Easter Eggs. 

The event timings are just for the meeting point as it is intended to move on to the various venues after this, likely to be the Old Dun Cow and/or Avalon.

Any latecomers should go to the Old Dun Cow, Avalon or any of the venues concerned close to the Juniper Tree and find the group.

The event will end when people want to go home .
