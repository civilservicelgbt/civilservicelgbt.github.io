The city of Bristol has been a city of action and acceptance for decades. To celebrate LGBT+ History Month, join us for a walking tour of LGBT+ spaces and places of note in Bristol throughout history. 

Meet fellow Civil Servants, celebrate Bristol’s LGBT+ History and enjoy a post-walk drink of your choice too.

The meeting spot will be in central Bristol, once registered, you will be notified of the exact location.

We are currently developing the final route, however will aim to make the route as flat as possible - which is no easy feat in Bristol - so we cannot guarantee the route will be fully accessible. 

The walk will last around 1.5-2 hours and be very gentle in pace with regular stops. 

If you have any accessibility needs or would like to talk to the host about the route further, please reach out to us at [southwest@civilservice.lgbt](mailto:southwest@civilservice.lgbt).
