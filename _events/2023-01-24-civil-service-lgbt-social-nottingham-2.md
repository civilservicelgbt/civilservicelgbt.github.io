The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

C﻿ome along to meet like minded civil servants at the East Midlands monthly social, this will be on the 16th of each month, or the closest Friday/Monday. 

T﻿he social will be held at Cured from 1615. However, if you wish to meet beforehand and arrive together then please make your way to Unity Square Bakewell Cafe at 1600.
