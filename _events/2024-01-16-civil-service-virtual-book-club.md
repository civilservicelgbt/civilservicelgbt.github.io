🌈 Join the vibrant world of literature and inclusivity with our Virtual LGBT+ Book Club! 📚🏳️‍🌈 Immerse yourself in a welcoming online community where diverse voices and stories take centre stage. From ground-breaking classics to contemporary gems, our club celebrates the rich tapestry of LGBTQ+ literature. Connect with like-minded individuals across the Civil Service, sharing insights and fostering meaningful discussions on the power of queer narratives.

Each month you will be given the choice of 5 books and you can vote for your favourite and whichever book gets the most votes we will read together and then end of the month we will meet up online and discuss our thoughts on the book. 

Every month, we delve into thought-provoking works that explore the nuances of identity, love, and resilience. Whether you're an avid reader or just starting your literary journey, our virtual gatherings provide a safe space to engage, learn, and connect. Expand your reading horizons, challenge perspectives, and amplify LGBTQ+ voices together. Embrace the joy of reading in a supportive digital environment. Join us on this enlightening journey of literary exploration and community building!
