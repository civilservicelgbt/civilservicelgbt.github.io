The Civil Service LGBT+ Network organises informal networking and social events so that LGBT+ civil servants can meet each other. Our [local organisers](/team) organise these events in various cities across the country.

Our Liverpool socials take place on the **first Thursday of each month**. 

O﻿ur chosen venue for the social is usually Tempest on Tithebarn, see the address above. In the event that this is closed for a private function we will automatically move location to Brasco Lounge, Mann Island Buildings, L3 1BP. We ususally stay at the initial location for at least a few hours. If you are coming along later than this, and want to check where we are, just email our North West local organisers.

If you have questions about this event, or you have an idea for a future event, you can contact our [North West local organisers](mailto:northwest@civilservice.lgbt).
