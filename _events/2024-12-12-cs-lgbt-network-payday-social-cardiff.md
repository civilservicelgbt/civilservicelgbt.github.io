The Civil Service LGBT+ Network host a number of events throughout the year. This event is being held in partnership with the Welsh Government LGBTI+ Network, PRISM. So why not join fellow Civil Servants on Friday 31 January for the first Cardiff social of 2025?

LGBTQ+ civil servants from both the Welsh and UK Governments are all welcome to join us (as well as our Scottish and Irish colleagues, if you’re in town.) Please also feel free to bring along your supportive partners, family and friends!

Mrs Potts’ Chocolate House is wheelchair accessible (except for the bathroom, which is down a flight of stairs) and serves a range of hot and cold soft drinks plus cakes and other desserts. Vegan, gluten-free and non-dairy options are all available.

If there’s interest from attendees, we will then move on to either Mary’s bar (opposite the venue) or the Golden Cross (on Hayes Bridge Road, a short walk away) from around 19:30 onwards. Mary’s is accessible aside from a short set of steps at the entry and serves both alcoholic and soft drinks, but does NOT serve food. The Golden Cross is fully accessible but again does not serve food.
